# Pipeline Stages for Blitz

These are the business rule transformations that are run on sourcefiles while in transit during a Blitz Start or a Blitz Build.

Each folder represents a business rule and should be separately applicable and not depend on each other.

For more information see [@blitzjs/file-pipeline](../../../file-pipeline/README.md)
