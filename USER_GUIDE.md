![Blitz Alpha User Guide](https://files-mgangy3vm.now.sh/alpha-user-guide.png)

<br>

Before getting started, you should know **this is alpha software**. Blitz is incomplete. There are rough spots and bugs. APIs may change. But you can build an app and deploy it to production. We're excited to see what you build!

If you have any issues at all, please join the [Blitz slack](https://slack.blitzjs.com) and tell us in the **#help** channel. If you get stuck and frustrated, please don't blame yourself. This user guide, and Blitz in general, is not yet fine-tuned for those with less experience. Eventually it will be because this is very important to us.

<br>

## Introduction

Blitz is a Rails-like framework for building monolithic, fullstack React apps. The idea is that Blitz makes you extremely productive by doing as much set up and grunt work for you.

**When building a Blitz app, you don’t have to think about “building an API” or “fetching data from your API”**. You only think about writing functions that get and change data. And to use those functions in your component, you simply import and call them like a regular function.

Blitz is built on Next.js, so if you are familiar with that, you will feel right at home.

<br>

## Blitz App Development

### Set Up Your Computer

- [ ] You need Node.js 12 or newer
- [ ] You need Postgres installed and running.

  - On macOS, you can use `brew install postgres` or install [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)

<br>

### Create Your Blitz App

1. `npm install -g blitz` or `yarn global add blitz`
2. Run `blitz new myAppName` to create a new blitz app in the `myAppName` directory
3. `cd myAppName`
4. `blitz start`
5. View your baby app at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

<br>

### Set Up Your Database

By default, Blitz uses Prisma 2 which is a strongly typed database client. You probably want to read [the Prisma 2 documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/introduction). _Note, Prisma 2 is not required for Blitz. The only Prisma-Blitz integration is the `blitz db` cli command. You can use anything you want, such as Mongo, TypeORM, etc._

1. Open `db/prisma.schema` and add the following:

```prisma
model Project {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name      String
  tasks     Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name        String
  project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId   Id
}
```

2. Run `blitz db migrate`
   - If this fails, you need to change the `DATABASE_URL` value in `.env` to whatever is required by your Postgres installation.

<br>
   
### Generate the CRUD Files

_CRUD = create, read, update, delete_

1. Run `blitz generate crud project`
2. Run `blitz generate crud task --parent project`
3. Open [https://localhost:3000/projects](https://localhost:3000/projects) to see the default project list page

<br>

### Pages

Blitz.js pages are exactly the same as Next.js pages. If you need, read [the Next.js Page documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

- Unlike Next.js, you can have many `pages/` folders nested inside `app/`. This way pages can be organized neatly, especially for larger projects. Like this:
  - `app/pages/about.tsx`
  - `app/projects/pages/projects/index.tsx`
  - `app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[id].tsx`
- All React components inside a `pages/` folder are accessible at a URL corresponding to it's path inside `pages/`. So `pages/about.tsx` will be at `localhost:3000/about`.

The Next.js router APIs are all exported from the `blitz` package: `useRouter()`, `withRouter()`, and `Router`. If you need, read [the Next.js Router documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router).

<br>

### Writing Queries & Mutations

Blitz queries and mutations are plain, asynchronous Javascript functions that always run on the server.

We automatically alias the root of your project, so `import db from 'db'` is importing `<project_root>/db/index.ts`

**Example Query:**

```ts
// app/products/queries/getProduct.tsx
import db, {FindOneProductArgs} from 'db'

export default async function getProduct(args: FindOneProductArgs) {
  // Can do any pre-processing or event triggers here
  const product = await db.product.findOne(args)
  // Can do any post-processing or event triggers here

  return product
}
```

**Example Mutation:**

```ts
// app/products/mutations/createProduct.tsx
import db, {ProductCreateArgs} from 'db'

export default async function createProduct(args: ProductCreateArgs) {
  // Can do any pre-processing or event triggers here
  const product = await db.product.create(args)
  // Can do any post-processing or event triggers here

  return product
}
```

<br>

### Using Queries

#### In a React Component

Blitz provides a `useQuery` hook, which is built on [`react-query`](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query). The first argument is a query function. The second argument is the input to the query function. The third argument is any valid react-query configuration item.

At build time, the direct function import is swapped out for a function that executes a network call to run the query serverside.

**React Concurrent Mode is enabled by default for Blitz apps.** So the `<Suspense>` component is used for loading states and `<ErrorBoundary>` is used to display errors. If you need, you can read the [React Concurrent Mode Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).

```tsx
import {Suspense} from 'react'
import {useRouter, useQuery} from 'blitz'
import getProduct from '/app/products/queries/getProduct'
import ErrorBoundary from 'app/components/ErrorBoundary'

function Product() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const id = parseInt(router.query.id as string)
  const [product] = useQuery(getProduct, {where: {id: props.query.id}})

  return <div>{product.name}</div>
}

export default function () {
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={(error) => <div>Error: {JSON.stringify(error)}</div>}>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Product />
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### On the Server

In `getStaticProps`, a query function can be called directly without `useQuery`

```tsx
import getProduct from '/app/products/queries/getProduct'

export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const product = await getProduct({where: {id: context.params?.id}})
  return {props: {product}}
}

export default function ({product}) {
  return <div>{product.name}</div>
}
```

In `getServerSideProps`, pass a query function to `ssrQuery` which will ensure appropriate middleware is run before/after your query function.

```tsx
import {ssrQuery} from 'blitz'
import getProduct from '/app/products/queries/getProduct'

export const getServerSideProps = async ({params, req, res}) => {
  const product = await ssrQuery(getProduct, {where: {id: params.id}}, {req, res}))
  return {props: {product}}
}

export default function({product}) {
  return <div>{product.name}</div>
}
```

For more details, read the comprehensive [Query & Mutation Usage Issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/89)

<br>

### Using Mutations

Mutations are called directly, like a regular asynchronous function.

At build time, the direct function import is swapped out for a function that executes a network call to run the mutation server-side.

```tsx
import {useQuery} from 'blitz'
import getProduct from '/app/products/queries/getProduct'
import updateProduct from '/app/products/mutations/updateProduct'

function (props) {
  const [product] = useQuery(getProduct, {where: {id: props.id}})

  return (
    <Formik
      initialValues={product}
      onSubmit={async values => {
        try {
          const product = await updateProduct(values)
        } catch (error) {
          alert('Error saving product')
        }
      }}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Formik>
  )
}
```

For more details, read the comprehensive [Query & Mutation Usage Issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/89)

<br>

### Custom API Routes

Blitz.js custom API routes are exactly the same as Next.js custom API routes. If you need, read [the Next.js API route documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

- Unlike Next.js, your `api/` folder must be a sibling of `pages/` instead of being nested inside.
- All React components inside an `api/` folder are accessible at a URL corresponding to it's path inside `api/`. So `app/projects/api/webhook.tsx` will be at `localhost:3000/api/webhook`.

<br>

### Customize the Webpack Config

Blitz uses the `blitz.config.js` config file at the root of your project. This is exactly the same as `next.config.js`. Read [the Next.js docs on customizing webpack](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config).

<br>

### Deploy to Production

1. You need a production Postgres database. It's easy to set this up on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/?refcode=466ad3d3063d).
2. For deploying serverless, you also need a connection pool. This is also relatively easy to set up on Digital Ocean.
   1. [Read the Digitial Ocean docs on setting up your connection pool](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/#creating-a-connection-pool?refcode=466ad3d3063d)
   2. Ensure you set your "Pool Mode" to be "Session" instead of "Transaction" (because of a bug in Prisma)
3. Lastly, you need your entire database connection string. If you need, [read the Prisma docs on this](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-connectors/postgresql#connection-details).
   1. If deploying to serverless with a connection pool, make sure you get the connection string to your connection pool, not directly to the DB.

#### Serverless

Assuming you already have a Zeit account and the `now` cli installed, you can do the following:

1. Add your DB url as a secret environment variable by running `now secrets add @database-url "DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING"`
2. Add a `now.json` at your project root with

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database-url"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "@database-url"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Run `now`

Once working and deployed to production, your app should be very stable because it’s running Next.js which is already battle tested.

#### Traditional, Long-Running Server

You can deploy a Blitz app like a regular Node or Express project.

`blitz start --production` will start your app in production mode. Make sure you provide the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for your production database.

<br>

## Blitz CLI Commands

#### `blitz new NAME`

Generate a new blitz project at `<current_folder>./NAME`

#### `blitz start`

Start your app in development mode

#### `blitz start --production`

Start your app in production mode

#### `blitz db migrate`

Run any needed migrations via Prisma 2 and generate Prisma Client

#### `blitz db introspect`

Will introspect the database defined in `db/schema.prisma` and automatically generate a complete `schema.prisma` file for you. Lastly, it'll generate Prisma Client.

#### `blitz db studio`

Open the Prisma Studio UI at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) so you can easily see and change data in your database.

#### `blitz generate crud MODEL [--parent MODEL]`

Generate all the CRUD files for a model. Your model input can be singular or plural, but the generated files will be the same in both cases.

#### `blitz console`

Here's the list of big things that are currently missing from Blitz but are top priority for us:

- A real Blitzjs.com website and documentation
- Translated documentation. If you're interested in helping, [comment in this issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com/issues/20).
- Authentication
- Authorization (use auth rules both on server and client)
- Model validation (use model validation both on server and client)
- `blitz new` including set up for testing, Prettier, ESLint, styling system (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc)
- React-Native support
- GUI for folks who prefer that over CLIs
- ... and tons more 🙂

<br>

## FAQ

- **Does Blitz support vanilla Javascript?** Yes, but `blitz new` generates all Typescript files right now. You can add new files with JS and/or convert the generated files to JS. There's an [open issue for generating vanilla JS files](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/160) that needs help.
- **Will you support other ESLint configs for the `blitz new` app?** Yes, there's [an issue for this](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/161)
