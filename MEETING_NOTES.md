- Brandon:
  - blitzjs.com published, docs + marketing site v0.1 live
  - For now most of the docs copied from react-query and Next, we should eventually clean them up so they&#39;re stylistically similar to ours, but really easy to start
  - HTTP middleware is almost done, just fixing a few edge cases
  - Authentication is up next after that, translating pseudocode into actual code
- Kristina:
  - Homepage design mostly wrapped up right now, have to finish up mobile and light mode and then ready to move on to the rest of the docs
  - Syntax highlighting, we can customize colors
  - Sidebar inspiration from tailwindcss
- Robert:
  - Decided to wait to convert existing components to theme UI until the final design is done
  - More docs content:
    - More guides
    - Improve the tutorial to incorporate relationship generation
  - Add branches for canary and master
    - If you add a feature you can add your documentation to the canary branch
- Adam:
  - blitz generate model finished!
  - Installer rewrite complete
    - At similar place to what Gatsby has for installing stuff
  - Next up:
    - Support gatsby MDX recipes
    - Make all code generators aware of actual model attributes
- Fran:
  - Working on a package for getting the blitz config anywhere - getConfig()
  - Prevent app from &quot;warming&quot; the server when deployed as server rather than serverless
  - Testing examples - e2e with cypress and unit tests with Jest so we can link to a testing setup in the docs/getting started guide
- Rudi:
  - Extracted out the @blitzjs/file-pipeline (previously synchronizer)
  - Extracted out the @blitzjs/display package
  - Working on various Next.js compatibility issues
