# Blitz ⚡️

Framework for building monolithic, full-stack, serverless React apps with zero data-fetching and zero client-side state management

### [👉View The Blitz Announcement Here👈](https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1229425878481793024)

## Welcome to the Blitz Community 👋

The Blitz community is warm, safe, diverse, inclusive, and fun! LGBTQ+, women, and minorities are especially welcome. There will be a **zero** tolerance policy for any type of harassment or discrimination. I (Brandon) will soon be posting the first RFC — an RFC for a code of conduct. First things first.

## Demo

The initial Blitz demo app is at [examples/first-demo](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/examples/first-demo/README.md). NOTE: The API is very alpha, and will change.

## I invite you to join me — let’s build the future of web dev together. 🤝
