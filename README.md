# Blitz ‚ö°Ô∏è

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fblitz-js%2Fblitz%2Fbadge%3Fref%3Dcanary&style=flat)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/blitz-js/blitz/goto?ref=canary)

Framework for building monolithic, full-stack React apps with zero data-fetching and zero client-side state management.

The developer experience is like Ruby on Rails (SSR so you don‚Äôt have to build an API with client-side data fetching), but the end-user experience is like an SPA (client side transitions, each page has a real URL, dynamic UI, etc). 100% Javascript and React. Can deploy as an entirely serverless app or to a traditional server.
