# Blitz ‚ö°Ô∏è

[![Financial Contributors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/blitzjs/all/badge.svg?label=financial+contributors)](https://opencollective.com/blitzjs) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fblitz-js%2Fblitz%2Fbadge%3Fref%3Dcanary&style=flat)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/blitz-js/blitz/goto?ref=canary)

Framework for building monolithic, full-stack React apps without building an API.

The central thesis for Blitz is most apps don't need a REST or GraphQL API. Blitz brings back the simplicity of server rendered frameworks like Ruby on Rails while preserving everything we love about React.

### What is Blitz Designed For?

Blitz is designed for tiny to large database-backed applications that have one or more graphical user interfaces.

Web support will be released first, followed by React Native. We are pursuing the dream of a single monolithic application that runs on web and mobile with maximum code sharing and minimal boilerplate.

### What are the Foundational Principles?

1. Fullstack & Monolithic
2. API Not Required
3. Convention over Configuration
4. Loose Opinions
5. Easy to Start, Easy to Scale
6. Stability
7. Community over Code

[The Blitz Manifesto](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/MANIFESTO.md) explains these principles in detail.
