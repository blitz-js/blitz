# Blitz ⚡️

Framework for building monolithic, full-stack, serverless React apps with zero data-fetching and zero client-side state management


## Welcome to the Blitz Community

The Blitz community is warm, safe, diverse, inclusive, and fun! LGBTQ+, women, and minorities are especially welcome. There will be a **zero** tolerance policy for any type of harassment or discrimination. I (Brandon) will soon be posting the first RFC — an RFC for a code of conduct. First things first.

There’s a LOT of work left and I can’t do it alone.
