These files are:

- The `app/` folder is a container for most of your project. This is where you’ll put any pages or API routes.

- `db/` is where your database configuration goes. If you’re writing models or checking migrations, this is where to go.

- `public/` is a folder where you will put any static assets. If you have images, files, or videos which you want to use in your app, this is where to put them.

- `integrations/` is a folder to put all third-party integrations like with Stripe, Sentry, etc.

- `test/` is a folder where you can put test utilities and integration tests.

- `package.json` contains information about your dependencies and devDependencies. If you’re using a tool like `npm` or `yarn`, you won’t have to worry about this much.

- `tsconfig.json` is our recommended setup for TypeScript.

- `.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.env`, etc. ("dotfiles") are configuration files for various bits of JavaScript tooling.

- `blitz.config.ts` is for advanced custom configuration of Blitz. [Here you can learn how to use it](https://blitzjs.com/docs/blitz-config).

- `jest.config.js` contains config for Jest tests. You can [customize it if needed](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration).

You can read more about it in the [File Structure](https://blitzjs.com/docs/file-structure) section of the documentation.

### Tools included

Blitz comes with a set of tools that corrects and formats your code, facilitating its future maintenance. You can modify their options and even uninstall them.

- **ESLint**: It lints your code: searches for bad practices and tell you about it. You can customize it via the `.eslintrc.js`, and you can install (or even write) plugins to have it the way you like it. It already comes with the [`blitz`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config) config, but you can remove it safely. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/eslint-config).
- **Husky**: It adds [githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), little pieces of code that get executed when certain Git events are triggerd. For example, `pre-commit` is triggered just before a commit is created. You can see the current hooks inside `.husky/`. If are having problems commiting and pushing, check out ther [troubleshooting](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot) guide. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/husky-config).
- **Prettier**: It formats your code to look the same everywhere. You can configure it via the `.prettierrc` file. The `.prettierignore` contains the files that should be ignored by Prettier; useful when you have large files or when you want to keep a custom formatting. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/prettier-config).
