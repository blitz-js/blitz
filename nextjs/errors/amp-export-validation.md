# AMP Export Validation

#### Why This Error Occurred

During export we validate AMP pages using [amphtml-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator). Errors received from the validator will fail the export.

Validation errors will cause pages to not be [indexed by AMP Caches](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/how_cached).
