# Nested Reserved Page

#### Why This Error Occurred

In your pages folder you nested a reserved page e.g. `_app`, `_error`, or `_document` which causes the page to not be used since they must be located directly under the pages folder.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Move the reserved pages directly under your pages folder so that they are picked up and used correctly.
