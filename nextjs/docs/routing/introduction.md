# Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the [concept of pages](/docs/basic-features/pages.md).

When a file is added to the `pages` directory it's automatically available as a route.

The files inside the `pages` directory can be used to define most common patterns.

#### Index routes

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`

#### Nested routes

The router supports nested files. If you create a nested folder structure files will be automatically routed in the same way still.

- `pages/blog/first-post.js` → `/blog/first-post`
- `pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` → `/dashboard/settings/username`

#### Dynamic route segments

To match a dynamic segment you can use the bracket syntax. This allows you to match named parameters.

- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug` (`/blog/hello-world`)
- `pages/[username]/settings.js` → `/:username/settings` (`/foo/settings`)
- `pages/post/[...all].js` → `/post/*` (`/post/2020/id/title`)

> Check out the [Dynamic Routes documentation](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md) to learn more about how they work.

## Linking between pages

The Next.js router allows you to do client-side route transitions between pages, similar to a single-page application.

A React component called `Link` is provided to do this client-side route transition.

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Home</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about">
          <a>About Us</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/blog/hello-world">
          <a>Blog Post</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Home
```

In the example above we have multiple links, each one maps a path (`href`) to a known page:

- `/` → `pages/index.js`
- `/about` → `pages/about.js`
- `/blog/hello-world` → `pages/blog/[slug].js`

### Linking to dynamic paths

You can also use interpolation to create the path, which comes in handy for [dynamic route segments](#dynamic-route-segments). For example, to show a list of posts which have been passed to the component as a prop:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${encodeURIComponent(post.slug)}`}>
            <a>{post.title}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Posts
```

> [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) is used in the example to keep the path utf-8 compatible.

Alternatively, using a URL Object:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <Link
            href={{
              pathname: '/blog/[slug]',
              query: { slug: post.slug },
            }}
          >
            <a>{post.title}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Posts
```

Now, instead of using interpolation to create the path, we use a URL object in `href` where:

- `pathname` is the name of the page in the `pages` directory. `/blog/[slug]` in this case.
- `query` is an object with the dynamic segment. `slug` in this case.

## Injecting the router

To access the [`router` object](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md#router-object) in a React component you can use [`useRouter`](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md#useRouter) or [`withRouter`](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md#withRouter).

In general we recommend using [`useRouter`](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md#useRouter).
