# TypeScript

AMP currently doesn't have built-in types for TypeScript, but it's in their roadmap ([#13791](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13791)).

As a workaround you can manually create a file called `amp.d.ts` inside your project and add these [custom types](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50601125).
