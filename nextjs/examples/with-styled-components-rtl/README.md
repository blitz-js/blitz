## Notes

Right to left allows to "flip" every element in your site to fit the needs of the cultures that are read from right to left (like arabic for example).

This example shows how to enable right to left styles using `styled-components`.

The good news, is there is no need of doing it manually anymore. `stylis-plugin-rtl` makes the transformation automatic.

From `pages/index.js` you can see, styles are `text-align: left;`, but what is actually applied is `text-align: right;`.
