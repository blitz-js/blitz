# Redis Example (with Upstash)

This example showcases how to use Redis as a data store in a Next.js project.

The example is a roadmap voting application where users can enter and vote for feature requests. It features the
following:

- Users can add and upvote items (features in the roadmap), and enter their email addresses to be notified about the
  released items.
- The API records the ip-addresses of the voters, so it does not allow multiple votes on the same item from the same IP
  address.

## Demo

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy Roadmap Voting App for your project/company
using [Vercel and Upstash](https://vercel.com/integrations/upstash) clicking the below button:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fupstash%2Fserverless-tutorials%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Froadmap-voting-app&env=LOGO&envDescription=Enter%20URL%20for%20your%20project%2Fcompany%20logo&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.upstash.com%2Fdocs%2Ftutorials%2Froadmap_voting_app&project-name=roadmap-voting&repo-name=roadmap-voting&demo-title=Roadmap%20Voting&demo-description=Roadmap%20Voting%20Page%20for%20Your%20Project&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Froadmap.upstash.com&integration-ids=oac_V3R1GIpkoJorr6fqyiwdhl17)

## Configuration

The application uses [Upstash](https://upstash.com) (Serverless Redis Database) as its data storage. During deployment,
you will be asked to integrate Upstash. The integration dialog will help you create an Upstash database for free and
link it to your Vercel project with the following steps:

### Deployment Steps

After clicking the deploy button, enter a name for your project. Then you will be asked to install Upstash integration.

### Maintenance

The application uses a Redis database to store the feature requests and emails. The features requests are kept in a
sorted set with name `roadmap`. You can connect to it via Redis-cli and manage the data using the
command `zrange roadmap 0 1000 WITHSCORES`. The emails are stored in a set with name `emails`. So you can get the list
by the command `smembers emails`.
