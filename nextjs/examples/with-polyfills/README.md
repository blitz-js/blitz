# With Polyfills

Next.js supports IE11 and all modern browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, et al) with no required configuration. It also adds [some polyfills](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#polyfills) by default.

If your own code or any external npm dependencies require features not supported by your target browsers, you need to add polyfills yourself.

In this case, you should add a top-level import for the specific polyfill you need in your Custom `<App>` or the individual component.

## Deploy your own
