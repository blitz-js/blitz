        <h1>The Idea Behind This Example</h1>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/nearform/graphql-hooks">GraphQL Hooks</a>{' '}
          is a library from NearForm that intends to be a minimal hooks-first
          GraphQL client. Providing it in a way familiar to Apollo users.
        </p>

        <p>
          This started life as a copy of the `with-apollo` example. We then
          stripped out Apollo and replaced it with `graphql-hooks`. This was
          mostly as an exercise in ensuring basic functionality could be
          achieved in a similar way to Apollo.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll see this shares the same{' '}
          <a href="https://www.graph.cool">graph.cool</a> backend as the Apollo
          example, this is so you can compare the two side by side. The app
          itself should also look identical.
