# Fast Refresh Demo

Next.js ships with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) which gives you instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components.

This demos shows how the state of an auto incrementing value and a classic counter is preserved after edits or if there are errors.
