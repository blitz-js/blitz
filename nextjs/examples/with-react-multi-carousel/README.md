## How does it work with ssr?

- On the server-side, we detect the user's device to decide how many items we are showing and then using flex-basis to assign \* width to the carousel item.
- On the client-side, old fashion getting width of the container and assign the average of it to each carousel item.

The UI part of this example is copy paste from for the sake of simplicity. [with-material-ui](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-material-ui)
