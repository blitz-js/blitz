# Consume local Apollo GraphQL schema to create Static Generation export

Next.js ships with two forms of pre-rendering: [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). This example shows how to perform Static Generation using a local [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) schema within [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation). The end result is a Next.js application that uses one Apollo GraphQL schema to generate static pages at build time and also serve a GraphQL [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) at runtime.

## Notes

### Static Export

If you wish to export a static HTML + JS version of the site you need to first change the setting in this example in `./pages/[username].js` where `getStaticPaths` has `fallback: true` - this needs to be `false` for static export to work. You can then run `npm run build` and `npm run export` to export the site as a static folder in `./out` directory.
