Next.js automatically supports Environment Variable loading as of [Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#new-environment-variables-support). Visit the [documentation for environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) to learn more and the [Environment Variables Example](/examples/environment-variables) to see it on action.

Now Secrets (previously used by this example) is no longer needed as you can now add environment variables directly in your [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project.
