# Example app implementing progressive server-side render

Sometimes you want to **not** server render some parts of your application.

For example:

1. Third party components without server render capabilities
2. Components that depend on `window` or other browser only APIs
3. Content isn't important enough for the user (eg. below the fold content)

To handle these cases, you can conditionally render your component using the `useEffect` hook.

This example features:

- A custom hook called `useMounted`, implementing this behavior
- An app with a component that must only be rendered in the client
- A loading component that will be displayed before rendering the client-only component
