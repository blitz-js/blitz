# AWS Amplify and Typescript with NextJS

[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-aws-amplify-typescript)

This example shows how to build a server rendered web application with NextJS and AWS Amplify. We use AWS Amplify to generate code and to manage and consume the AWS cloud resources needed for our app. The NextJS app has dynamic and static routes to demonstrate how to load data on the server based on the incoming request.

Two routes are implemented :

- `/` : A static route that uses getStaticProps to load data from AppSync and renders it on the server (Code in [pages/index.tsx](pages/index.tsx))

- `/todo/[id]` : A dynamic route that uses `getStaticProps` and the id from the provided context to load a single todo from AppSync and render it on the server. (Code in [pages/todo/[id].tsx](pages/todo/[id].tsx))

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-aws-amplify-typescript nextjs-aws-amplify-typescript-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-aws-amplify-typescript nextjs-aws-amplify-typescript-app
```
