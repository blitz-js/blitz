# MDX Remote Example

This example shows how a simple blog might be built using the [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library, which allows mdx content to be loaded via `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. The mdx content is loaded from a local folder, but it could be loaded from a database or anywhere else.

The example also showcases [next-remote-watch](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch), a library that allows next.js to watch files outside the `pages` folder that are not explicitly imported, which enables the mdx content here to trigger a live reload on change.

Since `next-remote-watch` uses undocumented Next.js APIs, it doesn't replace the default `dev` script for this example. To use it, run `npm run dev:watch` or `yarn dev:watch`.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-mdx-remote with-mdx-remote-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-mdx-remote with-mdx-remote-app
```

## Notes

### Conditional custom components

When using `next-mdx-remote`, you can pass custom components to the MDX renderer. However, some pages/MDX files might use components that are used infrequently, or only on a single page. To avoid loading those components on every MDX page, you can use `next/dynamic` to conditionally load them.

For example, here's how you can change `getStaticProps` to conditionally add certain components:

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// ...

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const { content, data } = matter(source)

  const components = {
    ...defaultComponents,
    SomeHeavyComponent: /<SomeHeavyComponent/.test(content)
      ? dynamic(() => import('SomeHeavyComponent'))
      : null,
  }

  const mdxSource = await renderToString(content, { components })
}
```

If you do this, you'll also need to check in the page render function which components need to be dynamically loaded. You can pass a list of component names via `getStaticProps` to accomplish this.
