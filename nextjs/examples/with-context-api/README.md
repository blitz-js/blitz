# Hello World example

This example shows how to use react context api in our app.

It provides an example of using `pages/_app.js` to include the context api provider and then shows how both the `pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js` can both share the same data using the context api consumer.

We start off by creating two contexts. One that actually never changes (`CounterDispatchContext`) and one that changes more often (`CounterStateContext`).

The `pages/index.js` shows how to, from the home page, increment and decrement the context data by 1 (a hard code value in the context provider itself).

The `pages/about.js` shows how to pass an increment value from the about page into the context provider itself.
