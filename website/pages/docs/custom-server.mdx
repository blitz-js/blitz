You can use the custom server feature if you need websocket support or
some other direct control over the web server itself.

### How {#how}

1. Add a `server.ts` or `server.js` file in your project root. Or you can
   use `server/index.js` or `server/index.ts`. See below for an example
   server.
2. Now `blitz dev` and `blitz start` will automatically detect and use
   your custom server.

### Example {#example}

Here's an example custom server:

```ts
// server.ts
import blitz from "blitz/custom-server"
import { createServer } from "http"
import { parse } from "url"
import { log } from "next/dist/server/lib/logging"

const { PORT = "3000" } = process.env
const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"
const app = blitz({ dev })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer((req, res) => {
    // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.
    // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url!, true)
    const { pathname } = parsedUrl

    if (pathname === "/hello") {
      res.writeHead(200).end("world")
      return
    }

    if (pathname === "/a") {
      // renders app/pages/a.tsx
      app.render(req, res, "/a", query)
      return
    }

    handle(req, res, parsedUrl)
  }).listen(PORT, () => {
    log.success(`Ready on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
})
```

The above `blitz/custom-server` import is a function that receives an
object with the following options:

- `dev`: `Boolean` - Whether or not to launch Blitz in dev mode. Defaults
  to `false`
- `dir`: `String` - Location of the Blitz project. Defaults to `'.'`
- `quiet`: `Boolean` - Hide error messages containing server information.
  Defaults to `false`
- `conf`: `object` - Defaults to `{}`

The returned `app` can then be used to let Blitz handle requests as
required.

## Disabling file-system routing {#disabling-file-system-routing}

By default, `blitz` will serve each file `pages` folders under a pathname
matching the filename. If your project uses a custom server, this behavior
may result in the same content being served from multiple paths, which can
present problems with SEO and UX.

To disable this behavior and prevent routing based on files in `pages`,
open `blitz.config.js` and disable the `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  useFileSystemPublicRoutes: false,
}
```

> Note that `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` disables filename routes from SSR;
> client-side routing may still access those paths. When using this
> option, you should guard against navigation to routes you do not want
> programmatically.

> You may also wish to configure the client-side router to disallow
> client-side redirects to filename routes; for that refer to
> [`router.beforePopState`](./router#router-object).

## Disabling hot reloading in development {#disabling-hot-reloading}

The default value for `customServer.hotReload` is `true`. Should you need
to disable hot reloading for your custom server, you can change the value
of it to `false`.

```js
module.exports = {
  customServer: {
    hotReload: false,
  },
}
```
