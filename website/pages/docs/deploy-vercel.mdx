title: Deploy Serverless to Vercel
sidebar_label: To Vercel

<Card type="info">
  Blitz itself runs great on Vercel. But be aware that Vercel is a
  platform optimized for frontend deployments, not fullstack. Because of
  Vercel's serverless nature, you have to do extra work for it to work
  well with SQL databases. Carefully read through the below database
  information.

## Serverless Peculiarities for SQL Databases {#peculiarities}

There are three main issues when it comes to using SQL databases in a
serverless environment:

### Problem 1: Separate Locations for App and Database {#locations}

Because Vercel doesn't provide databases, you will use a separate platform
for your database. And therefore people accidentally deploy their app to a
different region than their database.

**Solution:** Deploy your app and database to the same region. By default
Vercel apps are deployed to Washington D.C., so your database should be as
close as possible to that.

### Problem 2: Idle Connections {#idle-connections}

Ideally you will set up your database client and database connection
outside your API handler (this is the default setup in Blitz apps). This
optimizes performance because subsequent requests to the same lambda
already have an active database connection.

However, this can result in a large number of idle connections, larger
than what your database can support. For reference, the lowest database
tier on Digital Ocean has a limit of 22 connections.

**Solution:** Use a connection pool in front of your database. PgBouncer
is the most popular connection pool for PostgreSQL. Both Digital Ocean and
Heroku have a feature to simply add PgBouncer.

### Problem 3: Database Throughput {#database-throughput}

PgBouncer for PostgreSQL is advertised as allowing you to have
5,000-10,000 active database connections, but **it's critical to
understand that those are idle connections.** **PgBouncer does not
increase your core database capacity.** If your database has a max of 22
connections, then you can only have 22 simultaneous transactions,
regardless of whether you have PgBouncer in front of it or not.

**Solution:** Increase your database size to meet the traffic needs for
your app. But be aware this can become very expensive.

Note: Slow database transactions will greatly decrease your throughput. If
it seems you are running out of connections before you should, based on
your app traffic, then turn on logging for your database queries and look
for long transactions.

## Databases to Consider {#databases}

1. PostgreSQL + PgBouncer
2. [PlanetScaleDB](https://www.planetscale.com) - This is MySQL but seems
   to have solved the connection limit issue for serverless environments

## Guide for Using Digital Ocean with Vercel {#digitalocean}

This assumes your Blitz app is already set up for Postgres. If it's not,
first
[follow these instructions](./database-overview#switch-to-postgre-sql)

This also assumes you already have a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account.

1. You need a production Postgres database. It's straightforward to set
   this up on
   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/?refcode=eab6549a2fed).
   1. **It's extremely important that you choose the DB location to be in
      the same region as your Vercel deployment**. By default Vercel
      deployments are in Washington D.C., so you should choose the closest
      Digital Ocean location which is New York City.
2. You also need a connection pool. This is also relatively
   straightforward to set up on Digital Ocean.
   1. [Read the Digital Ocean docs on setting up your connection pool](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/#creating-a-connection-pool?refcode=466ad3d3063d)
   2. Ensure you set your "Pool Mode" to be "Transaction"
3. You need your entire database connection string. If you need,
   [read the Prisma docs on this](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-connectors/postgresql#connection-details).
   1. Make sure you get the connection string to your connection pool, not
      directly to the DB.
   2. If using PgBouncer (default connection pool on Digital Ocean), you
      must add `&pgbouncer=true` to the end of your connection string for
      Prisma to work correctly.
4. Change your build script in package.json to be
   `NODE_ENV=production blitz build && blitz prisma migrate deploy` so
   that the production DB will be migrated on each deploy
5. Add your DB url as a secret environment variable
   [using the UI](https://vercel.com/blog/custom-environments-ui) or by
   running `vercel env add DATABASE_URL`
6. Add your `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (It needs to be 32
   characters long)
   - On macOS and Linux, you can generate it by running
     `openssl rand -hex 16` in your terminal.
7. Run `git push` if using the
   [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations) or
   `vercel` if using Vercel CLI
