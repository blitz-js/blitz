The Blitz.js Script component enables developers to set the loading
priority of third-party scripts to save developer time and improve loading
performance.

Websites often need third parties for things like analytics, ads, customer
support widgets, and consent management. However, these scripts tend to be
heavy on loading performance and can drag down the user experience.
Developers often struggle to decide where to place them in an application
for optimal loading.

With `<Script>`, you can define the `strategy` property and Blitz.js will
optimize loading for the script:

- `beforeInteractive`: For critical scripts that need to be fetched and
  executed **before** the page is interactive, such as bot detection and
  consent management. These scripts are injected into the initial HTML
  from the server and run before self-bundled JavaScript is executed.
- `afterInteractive` (**default**): For scripts that can fetch and
  execute **after** the page is interactive, such as tag managers and
  analytics. These scripts are injected on the client-side and will run
  after hydration.
- `lazyOnload` For scripts that can wait to load during idle time, such as
  chat support and social media widgets.

> **Note:**
>
> - `<Script>` supports inline scripts with `afterInteractive` and
>   `lazyOnload` strategy.
> - Inline scripts wrapped with `<Script>` _require an `id` attribute to
>   be defined_ to track and optimize the script.

## Usage {#usage}

Previously, you needed to define `script` tags inside the `Head` of your
Blitz.js page.

```jsx
// Before

// pages/index.js
import { Head } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <script
          async
          src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"
        />
      </Head>
    </>
  )
}
```

Now, you use `<Script>` in the body of your page. It has client-side
functionality that decides when and how to load the remote script based on
the `strategy`.

> **Note:**
>
> - `<Script>` **must not** be placed in either a `<Head>` component or in
>   `_document.js`.

```jsx
// After

// pages/index.js
import { Script } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Examples {#examples}

### Loading Polyfills {#loading-polyfills}

```jsx
import { Script } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=IntersectionObserverEntry%2CIntersectionObserver"
        strategy="beforeInteractive"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Lazy-Loading {#lazy-loading}

```jsx
import { Script } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Executing Code After Loading (`onLoad`) {#after-load}

```jsx
import { Script } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        id="stripe-js"
        src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"
        onLoad={() => {
          this.setState({ stripe: window.Stripe("pk_test_12345") })
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Inline Scripts {#inline}

```jsx
import {Script} from 'blitz'

<Script strategy="lazyOnload">
  {`document.getElementById('banner').removeClass('hidden')`}
</Script>

// or

<Script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `document.getElementById('banner').removeClass('hidden')`
  }}
/>
```

### Forwarding Attributes {#forwarding-attributes}

```jsx
import { Script } from "blitz"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"
        id="analytics"
        nonce="XUENAJFW"
        data-test="analytics"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```
