## Usage {#usage}

The simplest way to use `<ErrorBoundary>` is to wrap it around any
component that may throw an error. This will handle errors thrown by that
component and its descendants too.

```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@blitzjs/next"

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  )
}

const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary
    FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
    onReset={() => {
      // reset the state of your app so the error doesn't happen again
    }}
  >
    <ComponentThatMayError />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

You can react to errors (e.g. for logging) by providing an `onError`
callback:

```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@blitzjs/next"

const myErrorHandler = (
  error: Error,
  info: { componentStack: string }
) => {
  // Do something with the error
  // E.g. log to an error logging client here
}

const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary
    FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
    onError={myErrorHandler}
  >
    <ComponentThatMayError />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

You can also use it as a
[higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html):

```jsx
import { withErrorBoundary } from "@blitzjs/next"

const ComponentWithErrorBoundary = withErrorBoundary(
  ComponentThatMayError,
  {
    FallbackComponent: ErrorBoundaryFallbackComponent,
    onError(error, info) {
      // Do something with the error
      // E.g. log to an error logging client here
    },
  }
)

const ui = <ComponentWithErrorBoundary />
```

### Error Recovery {#error-recovery}

In the event of an error if you want to recover from that error and allow
the user to "try again" or continue with their work, you'll need a way to
reset the ErrorBoundary's internal state. You can do this various ways,
but here's the most idiomatic approach:

```jsx
function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  )
}

function Bomb() {
  throw new Error("💥 CABOOM 💥")
}

function App() {
  const [explode, setExplode] = React.useState(false)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setExplode((e) => !e)}>
        toggle explode
      </button>
      <ErrorBoundary
        FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
        onReset={() => setExplode(false)}
        resetKeys={[explode]}
      >
        {explode ? <Bomb /> : null}
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  )
}
```

So, with this setup, you've got a button which when clicked will trigger
an error. Clicking the button again will trigger a re-render which
recovers from the error (we no longer render the `<Bomb />`). We also pass
the `resetKeys` prop which is an array of elements for the `ErrorBoundary`
to check each render (if there's currently an error state). If any of
those elements change between renders, then the `ErrorBoundary` will reset
the state which will re-render the children.

We have the `onReset` prop so that if the user clicks the "Try again"
button we have an opportunity to re-initialize our state into a good place
before attempting to re-render the children.

This combination allows us both the opportunity to give the user something
specific to do to recover from the error, and recover from the error by
interacting with other areas of the app that might fix things for us. It's
hard to describe here, but hopefully it makes sense when you apply it to
your specific scenario.

## API {#api}

### `ErrorBoundary` props {#error-boundary-props}

#### `children`

This is what you want rendered when everything's working fine. If there's
an error that React can handle within the children of the `ErrorBoundary`,
the `ErrorBoundary` will catch that and allow you to handle it gracefully.

#### `FallbackComponent`

This is a component you want rendered in the event of an error. As props
it will be passed the `error` and `resetErrorBoundary` (which will reset
the error boundary's state when called, useful for a "try again" button
when used in combination with the `onReset` prop).

This is required if no `fallback` or `fallbackRender` prop is provided.

#### `fallbackRender`

This is a render-prop based API that allows you to inline your error
fallback UI into the component that's using the `ErrorBoundary`. This is
useful if you need access to something that's in the scope of the
component you're using.

It will be called with an object that has `error` and
`resetErrorBoundary`:

```jsx
const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary
    fallbackRender={({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) => (
      <div role="alert">
        <div>Oh no</div>
        <pre>{error.message}</pre>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            // this next line is why the fallbackRender is useful
            resetComponentState()
            // though you could accomplish this with a combination
            // of the FallbackCallback and onReset props as well.
            resetErrorBoundary()
          }}
        >
          Try again
        </button>
      </div>
    )}
  >
    <ComponentThatMayError />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

I know what you're thinking: I thought we ditched render props when hooks
came around. Unfortunately, the current React Error Boundary API only
supports class components at the moment, so render props are the best
solution we have to this problem.

This is required if no `FallbackComponent` or `fallback` prop is provided.

#### `fallback`

In the spirit of consistency with the `React.Suspense` component, we also
support a simple `fallback` prop which you can use for a generic fallback.
This will not be passed any props so you can't show the user anything
actually useful though, so it's not really recommended.

```jsx
const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Oh no</div>}>
    <ComponentThatMayError />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

#### `onError`

This will be called when there's been an error that the `ErrorBoundary`
has handled. It will be called with two arguments: `error`, `info`.

#### `onReset`

This will be called immediately before the `ErrorBoundary` resets it's
internal state (which will result in rendering the `children` again). You
should use this to ensure that re-rendering the children will not result
in a repeat of the same error happening again.

`onReset` will be called with whatever `resetErrorBoundary` is called
with.

**Important**: `onReset` will _not_ be called when reset happens from a
change in `resetKeys`. Use `onResetKeysChange` for that.

#### `resetKeys`

Sometimes an error happens as a result of local state to the component
that's rendering the error. If this is the case, then you can pass
`resetKeys` which is an array of values. If the `ErrorBoundary` is in an
error state, then it will check these values each render and if they
change from one render to the next, then it will reset automatically
(triggering a re-render of the `children`).

We automatically reset any time the route changes. We effectively use
`resetKeys={[router.asPath]}` internally.

See the recovery examples above.

#### `onResetKeysChange`

This is called when the `resetKeys` are changed (triggering a reset of the
`ErrorBoundary`). It's called with the `prevResetKeys` and the
`resetKeys`.

### `useErrorHandler(error?: unknown)` {#use-error-handler}

React's error boundaries feature is limited in that the boundaries can
only handle errors thrown during React's lifecycles. To quote
[the React docs on Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html):

> Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
>
> - Event handlers
>   ([learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#how-about-event-handlers))
> - Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
> - Server side rendering
> - Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

This means you have to handle those errors yourself, but you probably
would like to reuse the error boundaries you worked hard on creating for
those kinds of errors as well. This is what `useErrorHandler` is for.

There are two ways to use `useErrorHandler`:

1. `const handleError = useErrorHandler()`: call `handleError(theError)`
2. `useErrorHandler(error)`: useful if you are managing the error state
   yourself or get it from another hook.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function Greeting() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = React.useState(null)
  const handleError = useErrorHandler()

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value
    fetchGreeting(name).then(
      (newGreeting) => setGreeting(newGreeting),
      handleError
    )
  }

  return greeting ? (
    <div>{greeting}</div>
  ) : (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input id="name" />
      <button type="submit">get a greeting</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

> Note, in case it's not clear what's happening here, you could also write
> `handleSubmit` like this:

```javascript
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  const name = event.target.elements.name.value
  fetchGreeting(name).then(
    (newGreeting) => setGreeting(newGreeting),
    (error) => handleError(error)
  )
}
```

Alternatively, let's say you're using a hook that gives you the error:

```javascript
function Greeting() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState("")
  const { greeting, error } = useGreeting(name)
  useErrorHandler(error)

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value
    setName(name)
  }

  return greeting ? (
    <div>{greeting}</div>
  ) : (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input id="name" />
      <button type="submit">get a greeting</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In this case, if the `error` is ever set to a truthy value, then it will
be propagated to the nearest error boundary.

In either case, you could handle those errors like this:

```javascript
const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
    <Greeting />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

And now that'll handle your runtime errors as well as the async errors in
the `fetchGreeting` or `useGreeting` code.
