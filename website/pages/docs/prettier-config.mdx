[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It
enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase.

It re-prints the parsed AST (abstract syntax tree) with its own rules that
take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary,
etc.

## Configuration File {#config}

Prettier uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)
for configuration file support. This means you can configure Prettier via
(in order of precedence):

- A "prettier" key in your package.json file.
- A .prettierrc file written in JSON or YAML.
- A .prettierrc.json, .prettierrc.yml, .prettierrc.yaml, or
  .prettierrc.json5 file.
- A .prettierrc.js, .prettierrc.cjs, prettier.config.js, or
  prettier.config.cjs file that exports an object using module.exports.
- A .prettierrc.toml file.

The configuration file will be resolved starting from the location of the
file being formatted, and searching up the file tree until a config file
is (or isn’t) found.

Prettier intentionally doesn’t support any kind of global configuration.
This is to make sure that when a project is copied to another computer,
Prettier’s behavior stays the same. Otherwise, Prettier wouldn’t be able
to guarantee that everybody in a team gets the same consistent results.

The full set of configuration options, including overrides and sharing
options can be found in the
[prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)

## Default Blitz config {#blitz-config}

By default, new Blitz apps configure prettier using the "prettier" key in
the
[package.json file](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/packages/generator/templates/app/package.ts.json)
