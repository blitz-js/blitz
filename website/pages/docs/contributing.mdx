👋 We're so excited you're interested in helping with Blitz! We happy to
help you get started, even if you don't have any previous open-source
experience :)

## First Things First {#first-things-first}

1. New to open source? take a look at
   [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
2. Familiarize yourself with the
   [Blitz Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct)
3. Learn [how the community operates](./how-the-community-operates)

## What to Work On? {#what-to-work-on}

Issues with the label
[`status/ready-to-work-on`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/labels/status%2Fready-to-work-on)
are the best place to start.

We also label issues as `good first issue` and `good second issue` when
appropriate.

If you find one that looks interesting and no one else is already working
on it, comment in the issue that you are going to work on it. But only
claim an issue if you can start work on it within a couple days.

Please ask as many questions as you need, either directly in the issue or
in Discord. We're happy to help!

The Blitzjs.com website and documentation repo also has issues with
[`ready to work on | help wanted`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22ready+to+work+on+%7C+help+wanted%22).

### Things that are ALWAYS welcome {#things-that-are-always-welcome}

- Adding tests
- Improved documentation
- Improved error messages
- Improved logging (i.e. more clear, more beautiful)
- Performance or security improvements
- Educational content like blogs, videos, courses

If there's some other way you'd like to contribute, ask us about it in
Discord!

After you contribute in any way, please add yourself as a contributor via
the
[@all-contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)!

## Our Codebase is a Garden {#our-codebase-is-a-garden}

The Blitz codebase is like a community garden. There's a lot of beautiful
plants and vegetables, but it won't take long until you find some weeds!
When you find weeds, please remove them :) Minor refactoring is always
encouraged. If you'd like to do some major refactoring, it's best to first
either open an issue or check with us in Discord. Most likely we'll agree
with you.

## What to Expect After Submitting a PR {#what-to-expect-after-submitting-a-pr}

A Blitz maintainer will review your PR, usually within a couple days.

If your PR changes user facing code, make sure you also made a PR to the
docs repo, otherwise this will block your PR from being merged.

You also need to add tests to cover the changes you made.

Once all the requirements are met and the maintainer is happy with your
code, they will merge it to the canary branch. It will then be included in
the next Blitz release.

Lastly, you will be added the all-contributors list as an official Blitz
contributor. **Congratulations!!**

## Project Management {#project-management}

We use a
[GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/projects/4) to
track all issues and PRs.

## Commit Access {#commit-access}

We give liberal commit access to the Blitz repo to anyone who is a
half-way regular contributor. This allows you to push branches directly to
the Blitz repo without using a fork.

We'll often give someone access if we notice they are regularly
contributing. But you're also welcome to ask for access if you are
regularly helping but haven't been given access yet.

In the main Blitz repo, code reviews by code owners are required to merge
PRs.

But in the docs repo, anyone can merge PRs once someone else has approved
the PR.

## Development Setup {#development-setup}

Make sure you're using Node 14 — Next uses `node-sass` which does not work
with newer Node versions.

**1.** Fork [the blitz repo](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz)

**2.** Clone your forked repo

```sh
# replace USERNAME below with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/blitz.git
cd blitz
```

**3.** (Optional, macOS only) Install required packages for
`sodium-native`

If you spot any issues related to `sodium-native`, run the following
command to fix it:

```sh
brew install autoconf automake
```

**4.** Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

**5.** Start the package server. This **must be running** for any package
development or example development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Running Tests {#running-tests}

### Blitz.js Tests {#blitz-tests}

#### Unit Tests

Most Blitz packages in `packages/` have jest unit tests.

- Run tests in a single package by running `pnpm test` inside that package
  folder (like `packages/blitz-next`)
- Run all unit tests from the repo root by running `pnpm test`. (Make sure
  you have ran `pnpm build` or `pnpm dev` prior to running this). Note:
  this will run all tests, including integration tests.

#### Integration Tests

Blitz integration tests are inside the root `integration-tests/` folder.

Make sure you have `chromedriver` installed for your Chrome version. You
can install it with

- `brew install --cask chromedriver` on Mac OS X
- `chocolatey install chromedriver` on Windows
- Or manually download the version that matches your installed chrome
  version (if there's no match, download a version under it, but not
  above) from the
  [chromedriver repo](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
  and add the binary to `<blitz-repo>/node_modules/.bin`

You can run all tests (both unit tests and integration tests) by running
`pnpm test` from the repo root.

You can manually run the integration app by running `blitz dev` inside the
integration test folder, like `integration-tests/auth/`.

### Testing Development Version of Blitz Inside an App {#testing-development-version-of-blitz}

<Card type="info">

Currently, to test the local dev version of Blitz, you can test an app
inside the `blitz/apps/` folder. In there, the blitz dependency will
automatically use the local dev version. We use it for development
testing. You must also make sure you are running `pnpm dev` in the `blitz`
folder at the same time.

</Card>

#### Link the Blitz CLI (Optional)

The following will link the development CLI as a local binary so you can
use it anywhere for testing.

```sh
pnpm link ./packages/blitz
```

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you run into issues that should be documented here, please submit a PR!
❤️

#### Git errors

Are you unable to commit? Do you get errors like `command not found` or
`stdin is not a tty`? That's probably a Husky error! Try checking their
[troubleshoot guide](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot).

#### Preconstruct errors

If you run into symlink and EPERM errors when trying to run Preconstruct
on Windows, you may need to enable
[Windows Developer Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/292914/what-is-developer-mode-in-windows-10/)
so that Preconstruct can create symlinks.

#### Missing files in Windows

If you have errors about missing files even after you run `pnpm build`,
try cloning again your repository with the configuration `core.symlinks`
set to `true` like this: `git clone -c core.symlinks=true <URL>`.
