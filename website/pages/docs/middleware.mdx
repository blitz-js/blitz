title: HTTP Middleware
sidebar_label: HTTP Middleware

HTTP Middleware is the escape hatch for [queries](./query-resolvers) and
[mutations](./mutation-resolvers) to access HTTP primitives. Middleware
can then pass data to queries and mutations using the middleware
`res.blitzCtx` parameter.

Middleware should not be used for business logic, because HTTP middleware
is less composable and harder to test than queries and mutations. All
business logic should live in queries & mutations.

For example, authentication middleware can set and read cookies and pass
the session object to queries and mutations via the context object. Then
queries and mutations will use the session object to perform authorization
and whatever else they need to do.

## Global Middleware {#global-middleware}

Global middleware runs for every Blitz query and mutation. It can be defined in `app/blitz-server` by using a helper function in the plugin array.

## `BlitzServerMiddleware` {#blitz-server-middleware}

`BlitzServerMiddleware ` is a utility function that can be used to add a global server middleware.
It converts a request middleware to a Blitz-compatible server plugin.

### Example {#blitz-server-middleware-example}

```ts
...
import {BlitzServerMiddleware} from "blitz"
import {BlitzGuardMiddleware} from "@blitz-guard/core/dist/middleware"
...

export const { gSSP, gSP, api } = setupBlitzServer({
  plugins: [
    AuthServerPlugin({
      ...authConfig,
      storage: PrismaStorage(db),
      isAuthorized: simpleRolesIsAuthorized,
    }),
    BlitzServerMiddleware(BlitzGuardMiddleware({
      excluded: [
        '/api/rpc/signup'
      ]
    }))
  ],
})
```

### API {#blitz-server-middleware-api}

```ts
BlitzServerMiddleware(middleware())
```

#### Arguments

- `middleware:` A request middleware function with `req`, `res` & `next` arguments.
  - **Required**

#### Returns

A `BlitzServerPlugin` that can be initialized inside the `app/blitz-server` setup file.


## Global Ctx Type {#global-ctx-type}

You can access the type of the `res.blitzCtx` parameter by importing `Ctx`
from `blitz`. The default `Ctx` provided by Blitz is an empty object.

You can extend the `Ctx` type by placing the following file in your
project (this is included in new apps by default).

```ts
// types.ts
import { DefaultCtx, SessionContext } from "blitz"

declare module "blitz" {
  export interface Ctx extends DefaultCtx {
    session: SessionContext
  }
}
```

Whatever types you add to `Ctx` will be automatically available in
your queries and mutations as shown here.

```ts
import { Ctx } from "blitz"

export default async function getThing(input, ctx: Ctx) {
  // Properly typed
  ctx.session
}
```

## Middleware API {#middleware-api}

This API is essentially the same as connect/Express middleware but with an
asynchronous `next()` function like Koa. The main difference when writing
connect vs Blitz middleware is you must return a promise from Blitz
middleware by doing `return next()` or `await next()`. See below for the
`connectMiddleware()` adapter for existing connect middleware.

```js
import { RequestMiddleware } from "blitz"

const middleware: RequestMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
  await next()
  console.log("Query/middleware result:", res.blitzResult)
}
```

### Arguments {#arguments}

- `req`: `MiddlewareRequest`
  - An instance of
    [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage),
    plus the following:
  - `req.cookies` - An object containing the cookies sent by the request.
    Defaults to `{}`
  - `req.query` - An object containing the
    [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). Defaults
    to `{}`
  - `req.body` - An object containing the body parsed by `content-type`,
    or `null` if no body was sent
- `res`: `MiddlewareResponse`
  - An instance of
    [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse),
    plus the following:
  - `res.blitzCtx` - An object that is passed as the second argument to
    queries and mutations. This is how middleware communicates with the
    rest of your app
  - `res.blitzResult` - The returned result from a query or mutation. To
    read from this, you must first `await next()`
  - `res.status(code)` - A function to set the status code. `code` must be
    a valid
    [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
  - `res.json(json)` - Sends a JSON response. `json` must be a valid JSON
    object
  - `res.send(body)` - Sends the HTTP response. `body` can be a `string`,
    an `object` or a `Buffer`
- `next()`: `MiddlewareNext`
  - **Required**: Callback for continuing the middleware chain. You must
    call this inside your middleware
  - **Required:** Returns a promise so you must either `await` it or
    return it like `return next()`. The promise resolves once all
    subsequent middleware has completed (including the Blitz query or
    mutation).

## Communicating Between Middleware and Query/Mutation Resolvers {#communicating-between-middleware-and-query-mutation-resolvers}

### From Middleware to Resolvers {#from-middleware-to-resolvers}

Middleware can pass anything, including data, objects, and functions, to
Blitz queries and mutations by adding to `res.blitzCtx`. At runtime,
`res.blitzCtx` is automatically passed to the query/mutation handler as
the second argument.

1. You must add to `res.blitzCtx` **before** calling `next()`
2. Keep in mind other middleware can also modify `res.blitzCtx`, so be
   sure to program defensively because anything can happen.

### From Resolvers to Middleware {#from-resolvers-to-middleware}

There are two ways middleware can receive data, objects, and functions
from resolvers:

1. `res.blitzResult` will contain the exact result returned from the
   query/mutation resolver. But you must first `await next()` before
   reading this. `await next()` will resolve once all subsequent
   middleware is run, including the Blitz internal middleware that runs
   the query/mutation resolver.
2. You can pass a callback into the resolver via `res.blitzCtx` and then
   the resolver can pass data back to the middleware be calling
   `ctx.someCallback(someData)`

## Error Handling {#error-handling}

#### Short Circuit the Request

Normally this is the type of error you expect from middleware. Because
middleware should not have business logic, so you won't be throwing
authorization errors for example. Usually, an error in middleware means
something is really wrong with the incoming request.

There are two ways to short circuit the request:

1. `throw` an error from inside your middleware
2. Pass an Error object to `next` like `next(error)`

#### Handle via Normal Query/Mutation Flow

Another uncommon way to handle a middleware error is to pass it to the
query/mutation and then throw the error from there.

```ts
// In middleware
res.blitzCtx.error = new Error()

// In query/mutation
if (ctx.error) throw ctx.error
```

## Connect/Express Compatibility {#connect-express-compatibility}

Blitz provides a `connectMiddleware()` function that converts connect
middleware to Blitz middleware.

```ts
// blitz.config.js
const { connectMiddleware } = require("blitz")
const Cors = require("cors")

const cors = Cors({
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"],
})

module.exports = {
  middleware: [connectMiddleware(cors)],
}
```

### Arguments {#arguments-1}

- `middleware` - Any connect/express middleware.
