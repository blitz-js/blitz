Want to get better at developing applications using Blitz, but don't know
where to start? You've come to the right spot.

This document is inspired by the
[Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). It curates
material on concepts & ideas, tools & libraries and history & trivia
useful to become better at building applications. It is tailored to Blitz,
but most will happily apply elsewhere.

Links marked with 🥷 are advanced. If you're dipping your toes into web
development, it's totally OK to skip them.
