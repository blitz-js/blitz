### Set Up Your Computer {#set-up-your-computer}

You need Node.js 16 or newer. You can verify this by running `node -v` in
your terminal. If you don't have Node or need a newer version, we
recommend using a node version manager like
[fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm). That will allow you to change node
versions and even have different versions for each project.

### Install Blitz {#install-blitz}

Run `yarn global add blitz` or `npm install -g blitz`.

### Create a New App {#create-a-new-app}

1. `blitz new myAppName`
2. `cd myAppName`
3. `blitz dev`
4. View your brand new app at
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
