Blitz "Zero-API" data layer (Blitz RPC) is focused on making the
communication between server and client seamless. It lets you

<strong>import server code directly into your components</strong> instead of
having to manually add API endpoints and do client-side fetching and caching.

Here's a quick overview:

#### Queries and mutations

Queries and mutations only run on the server — at build time, the direct
function import is replaced with an RPC network call. So the query
function code is never included in your client code. It's instead moved to
an API layer.
