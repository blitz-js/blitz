<Card type="caution">

This is documentation for using Blitz queries and mutations in a non-Blitz
app. For example, from a mobile application or some other app.

**For using queries and mutations in your app, refer to
[Using Queries](./query-usage) and [Using Mutations](./mutation-usage).**

**If you want to access your app e.g. as an external API, take a look at
[API Routes](./api-routes) instead.**

## URL {#url}

There are three options to determine how the RPC path is resolved during
build.

- `queries|mutations` (default)
  - Use the `queries` or `mutations` folder as the root
- `root`
  - Uses the path starting from the root of the project
- Custom function
  - This function gets called for every file path that needs to be
    resolved.

Example:

```
File: app/products/queries/getProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/getProduct
"root" URL: app/products/queries/getProduct

File: app/products/mutations/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/createProduct
"root" URL: app/products/mutations/createProduct

File: app/products/mutations/v2/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/v2/createProduct
"root" URL: app/products/mutations/v2/createProduct
```

#### Changing resolverPath option

To change how every file path is resolved, you can set the `resolverPath`
option inside next.config.js to one the three previously mentioned
options:

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: "queries|mutations",
  },
})

// Or with a custom function
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: (filePath) => {
      return filePath.replace("app/", "") // Removes `app/` from the path
    },
  },
})
```

## Request Details {#request-details}

From an HTTP perspective there is no difference between a query and
mutation. They are both function calls that get transformed into POST
requests.

## HEAD {#head}

Warms up the lambda. For example, when a component renders on the client
that uses a mutation, it will issue a HEAD request to the mutation
endpoint immediately on page load so that there's a much higher chance the
actual mutation request will hit a warm lambda.

Must always return HTTP `200 OK`

### HEAD Responses {#head-responses}

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## POST {#post}

Executes the query or mutation.

Request body must be JSON with the following keys:

- params (required) - This will be provided as the first argument to the
  query or mutation
- version (optional) - String containing the version of the built RPC
  client

Response body is JSON with the following keys:

- result - the exact result returned from the query/mutation function or
  null if there was an error
- error - null if success, otherwise an object.

**Example POST body:**

```json
{
  "params": {
    "where": {
      "id": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### POST Responses {#post-responses}

#### Success

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "result": {
    "name": "Hello World",
    "description": "This is awesome :)"
  },
  "error": null
}
```

#### Bad Request (Not JSON)

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "message": "Request body is not valid JSON"
  }
}
```

#### Bad Request (Missing params)

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "message": "Request body is missing the 'params' key"
  }
}
```

#### Not Found (Wrong method)

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

## Versioning {#versioning}

Any time you have client-server communication, there is a very real risk
of the client & server code becoming out of sync and causing an error. For
example, let's say you have a mutation function whose input is a single
object. You decide to change the mutation input to be a single array. You
make the change and deploy it. Your server code is now updated, but all
your users still have the old client code running in the browser. So it's
likely you now have client code sending an object to your mutation which
is going to error because it's expecting an array.

Now one solution is to only make changes that are backwards compatible,
but sometimes you can't do this.

The other solution is to track the version of your client code and your
server code. If there is a version mismatch, you can display a friendly
message to the user, telling them they need to reload the webpage to
continue.

```js
// *: example of an RPC call shielded by a friendly message to the user
```
