Blitz provides a completely custom templating language for use in custom
templates. The goal was for templates to always be valid syntax in
whatever language you're writing, rather than getting syntax errors in
your IDE and having to build the template to see if its output is correct
like you do with embedded languages like EJS.

### Variable Interpolation {#variable-interpolation}

This is the core of any templating language, and this syntax should be
fairly familiar if you've used Handlebars or anything similar. To insert a
variable that's been provided to the template's context argument, surround
it with double underscores: `__`.

```typescript
// Input
export default function __ModelName__Home() {
  return <div />
}

// Output
export default function TodosHome() {
  return <div />
}
```

### Conditional Expressions {#conditional-expressions}

In order to retain our first principle of valid syntax, conditional
expressions currently only work in TypeScript templates. At runtime we
place all of the provided template context values onto `process.env`, and
when compiling the template we search for any conditional expressions
against a valid template value on `process.env`. This works both for
traditional `if` statements as well as ternary operations. Soon we hope to
add support for conditional expressions in JSX for conditional component
insertion as well.

If you access a variable that _isn't_ a template value it is ignored,
allowing functionality like dead code elimination via
`process.env.NODE_ENV` into template to work properly.

The conditions are not dynamically evaluated, they're only checked for
truthiness. This means that for dynamic evaluation you'll need to do the
check ahead of time and pass it into the template as context, a check like
`if (process.env.componentName === 'SomeComp')` will not work properly.

```typescript
// Input
export default function __ModelName__Home() {
  if (process.env.includeAnalytics) {
    useEffect(() => {
      setupAnalytics()
    }, [])
  }
  // ...
}

// Output (includeAnalytics: true)
export default function __ModelName__Home() {
  useEffect(() => {
    setupAnalytics()
  }, [])
  // ...
}

// Output (includeAnalytics: false)
export default function __ModelName__Home() {
  // ...
}
```

### Conditional JSX Expressions {#conditional-jsx-expressions}

In the case where you need to conditionally insert different JSX into your
templates, the `process.env` solution isn't ideal. Because we only do
naive replacement of the inner node, if you embed a `process.env`
conditional in JSX you'll have something like this:

```tsx
// input
function MyLink() {
  return (
    <>
      {process.env.useLinkWrapper ? (
        <Link>
          <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
        </Link>
      ) : (
        <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

// output
function MyLink() {
  return (
    <>
      {
        <Link>
          <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
        </Link>
      }
    </>
  )
}
```

As you can see, the curly braces that wrap the inner script will persist
in the template output. This is where we can use our custom JSX
conditional syntax. The generator exposes two new JSX elements to TSX
templates: `<if condition="value" />` and `<else />`. Their behavior is
exactly the same as a standard `process.env` conditional. The `condition`
prop on the `if` statement is read out of the template context. If its
value is truthy the first child of `<if />` will be rendered, otherwise
the contents of the `<else />` element will be rendered.

<Card type="info">

Both `<if />` and `<else />` only accept a **single child component.** You
will see unexpected behavior and errors if you try to provide a fragment
or multiple elements.

```tsx
// input
function MyLink() {
  return (
    <if condition="useLinkWrapper">
      <Link>
        <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
      </Link>
      <else>
        <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
      </else>
    </if>
  )
}

// output
function MyLink() {
  return (
    <Link>
      <a href="//blitzjs.com">Blitz</a>
    </Link>
  )
}
```

_Interested in helping with the templating language? There's plenty of
room for improvement including supporting loops and iteration, actual
evaluation of conditionals rather than only truthiness checks, and more!
