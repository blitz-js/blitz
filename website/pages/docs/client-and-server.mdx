Blitz is focused on making the communication between server and client
seamless. That means you can import and use server code directly in your
UI components. However, you might be wondering what runs on the server and
what runs on the client. Here's a quick overview.

#### Framework Adapters

Blitz offers adapters for frameworks that allow you to inject plugins like
the RPC or auth plugin. For more information regarding specific adapters
head to the associated section in the documenation.

#### Queries and mutations

Queries and mutations only run on the server — at build time, the direct
function import is replaced with an RPC network call. So the query
function code is never included in your client code. It's instead moved to
an API layer.

#### React Components

Some data doesn't exist on the client's first render (e.g. session), which
causes a quick "flash". You can use
`Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true` to hide the first render.
