**Alias: `blitz c`**

Starts a Node.js REPL with your [database](./database-overview) and all
your [queries](./query-resolvers) and [mutations](./mutation-resolvers)
preloaded.

This makes it very simple to read or write to your database and run
one-off commands using your queries or mutations. It's also great for
testing and rapid prototype exploration.
