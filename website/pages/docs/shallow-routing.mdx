Shallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching
methods again, that includes [`getServerSideProps`](get-server-side-props)
and [`getStaticProps`](get-static-props).

You'll receive the updated `pathname` and the `query` via the
[`router` object](router#router-object) (added by
[`useRouter`](router#use-router) or [`withRouter`](router#use-router)),
without losing state.

To enable shallow routing, set the `shallow` option to `true`. Consider
the following example:

```ts
import {useEffect} from "react"
import {useRouter} from "blitz"

// Current URL is '/'
function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Always do navigations after the first render
    router.push("/?counter=10", undefined, {shallow: true})
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    // The counter changed!
  }, [router.query.counter])
}

export default Page
```

The URL will get updated to `/?counter=10` and the page won't get
replaced, only the state of the route is changed.

You can also watch for URL changes via
[`componentDidUpdate`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate)
as shown below:

```ts
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router
  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop
  if (query.counter !== prevProps.router.query.counter) {
    // fetch data based on the new query
  }
}
```

## Caveats {#caveats}

Shallow routing **only** works for same page URL changes. For example,
let's assume we have another page called `pages/about.ts`, and you run
this:

```ts
router.push("/?counter=10", "/about?counter=10", {shallow: true})
```

Since that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one
and wait for data fetching even though we asked to do shallow routing.
