<Card type="info">

`getStaticProps` should only be used for pages that do not require
authentication. The statically generated pages will be publicly available
via your server and via a CDN if you have one. Therefore they cannot
contain any personal or sensitive data.

Also, this is why there is no `req` and `res` objects for
`getStaticProps`, because the pages are generated at build time, not at
runtime. And at build time, there is no user http request to handle.

</Card>

If you export an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from a
[page](./pages), Blitz will pre-render this page at build time using the
props returned by `getStaticProps`.

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

The `context` parameter is an object containing the following keys:

- `params` contains the route parameters for pages using dynamic routes.
  For example, if the page name is `[id].js` , then `params` will look
  like `{ id: ... }`. To learn more, take a look at the
  [Dynamic Routing documentation](/docs/routing#dynamic-route-segments).
  You should use this together with `getStaticPaths`, which we’ll explain
  later.
- `preview` is `true` if the page is in the preview mode and `undefined`
  otherwise. See the [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).
- `previewData` contains the preview data set by `setPreviewData`. See the
  [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).

- `locale` contains the active locale (if enabled).
- `locales` contains all supported locales (if enabled).
- `defaultLocale` contains the configured default locale (if enabled).

`getStaticProps` should return an object with:

- `props` - A **required** object with the props that will be received by
  the page component. It should be a
  [serializable object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)
- `revalidate` - An **optional** amount in seconds after which a page
  re-generation can occur. Defaults to `false`. When `revalidate` is
  `false` it means that there is no revalidation, so the page will be
  cached as built until your next build. More on
  [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/get-static-props#incremental-static-regeneration)
- `notFound` - An **optional** boolean value to allow the page to return a
  404 status and page. Below is an example of how it works:

  ```js
  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
    const data = await res.json()

    if (!data) {
      return {
        notFound: true,
      }
    }

    return {
      props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
    }
  }
  ```

  > **Note**: `notFound` is not needed for
  > [`fallback: false`](/docs/get-static-paths#fallback-false) mode as
  > only paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be pre-rendered.

- `redirect` - An **optional** redirect value to allow redirecting to
  internal and external resources. It should match the shape of
  `{ destination: string | RouteUrlObject, permanent: boolean }`. In some
  rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older HTTP
  Clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the
  `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both.
  Below is an example of how it works:

  ```js
  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://...`)
    const data = await res.json()

    if (!data) {
      return {
        redirect: {
          destination: "/", // or using Blitz routes: Routes.HomePage()
          permanent: false,
        },
      }
    }

    return {
      props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
    }
  }
  ```

  > **Note**: Redirecting at build-time is currently not allowed and if
  > the redirects are known at build-time they should be added in
  > [`blitz.config.js`](/docs/blitz-config#redirects).

> **Note**: You can import modules in top-level scope for use in
> `getStaticProps`. Imports used in `getStaticProps` will
> [not be bundled for the client-side](#write-server-side-code-directly).
>
> This means you can write **server-side code directly in
> `getStaticProps`**. This includes reading from the filesystem or a
> database.

> **Note**: You should not use
> [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
> to call an API route in `getStaticProps`. Instead, directly import the
> logic used inside your API route. You may need to slightly refactor your

### Example {#example}

**Example**: Your blog page needs to load it's data from your database or
from a CMS (content management system).

```jsx
function Blog({posts}) {
  // Render posts...
}

// This function gets called during pre-rendering
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // 1. Use a Blitz query
  // 2. Directly access your database
  // 3. Or call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const posts = /* ... */

  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

### When should I use `getStaticProps`? {#when-should-i-use-get-static-props}

You should use `getStaticProps` if:

- The data for the page is not private and can be publicly available
- The data comes from headless CMS.
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific).
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast —
  `getStaticProps` generates HTML and JSON files, both of which can be
  cached by a CDN for performance.

### TypeScript: Use `GetStaticProps` {#type-script-use-get-static-props}

For TypeScript, you can use the `GetStaticProps` type from `blitz`:

```ts
import { GetStaticProps } from "blitz"

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  // ...
}
```

If you want to get inferred typings for your props, you can use
`InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>`, like this:

```tsx
import { InferGetStaticPropsType } from "blitz"

type Post = {
  author: string
  content: string
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://.../posts")
  const posts: Post[] = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

function Blog({ posts }: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  // will resolve posts to type Post[]
}

export default Blog
```

### Incremental Static Regeneration {#incremental-static-regeneration}

With `getStaticProps` you don't have to stop relying on dynamic content,
as **static content can also be dynamic**. Incremental Static Regeneration
allows you to update _existing_ pages by re-rendering them in the
background as traffic comes in.

Inspired by [stale-while-revalidate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861),
background regeneration ensures traffic is served uninterruptedly, always
from static storage, and the newly built page is pushed only after it's
done generating.

Consider our previous [`getStaticProps` example](#simple-example), but now
with regeneration enabled:

```jsx
function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if
// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // 1. Use a Blitz query
  // 2. Directly access your database
  // 3. Or call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch("https://.../posts")
  const posts = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every second
    revalidate: 1, // In seconds
  }
}

export default Blog
```

Now the list of blog posts will be revalidated once per second; if you add
a new blog post it will be available almost immediately, without having to
re-build your app or make a new deployment.

This works perfectly with
[`fallback: true`](/docs/get-static-paths#fallback-true). Because now you
can have a list of posts that's always up to date with the latest posts,
and have a [blog post page](/docs/get-static-paths#fallback-pages) that
generates blog posts on-demand, no matter how many posts you add or
update.

#### Static content at scale

Unlike traditional SSR,
[Incremental Static Regeneration](#incremental-static-regeneration)
ensures you retain the benefits of static:

- No spikes in latency. Pages are served consistently fast
- Pages never go offline. If the background page re-generation fails, the
  old page remains unaltered
- Low database and backend load. Pages are re-computed at most once
  concurrently

### Reading files: Use `process.cwd()` {#reading-files-use-process-cwd}

Files can be read directly from the filesystem in `getStaticProps`.

In order to do so you have to get the full path to a file.

Since Blitz compiles your code into a separate directory you can't use
`__dirname` as the path it will return will be different from the pages
directory.

Instead you can use `process.cwd()` which gives you the directory where
Blitz is being executed.

```jsx
import fs from "fs"
import path from "path"

// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <h3>{post.filename}</h3>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries. See the "Technical details" section.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "posts")
  const filenames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

  const posts = filenames.map((filename) => {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8")

    // Generally you would parse/transform the contents
    // For example you can transform markdown to HTML here

    return {
      filename,
      content: fileContents,
    }
  })
  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

### Technical details {#technical-details}

#### Only runs at build time

Because `getStaticProps` runs at build time, it does **not** receive data
that’s only available during request time, such as query parameters or
HTTP headers as it generates static HTML.

#### Write server-side code directly

Note that `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side. It will never be
run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the
browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries
without them being sent to browsers. You should not fetch an **API route**
from `getStaticProps` — instead, you can write the server-side code
directly in `getStaticProps`.

You can use [this tool](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/) to verify
what Blitz eliminates from the client-side bundle.

#### Statically Generates both HTML and JSON

When a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in
addition to the page HTML file, Blitz generates a JSON file holding the
result of running `getStaticProps`.

This JSON file will be used in client-side routing through `<Link>` or the
Blitz `router`. When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using
`getStaticProps`, Blitz fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build
time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that
client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only
the exported JSON is used.

#### Only allowed in a page

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a [page](./pages). You can’t
export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all
the required data before the page is rendered.

Also, you must use `export async function getStaticProps() {}` — it will
**not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page
component.

#### Runs on every request in development

In development (`blitz dev`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every
request.

#### First Render UX

Even though a page with `getStaticProps` will be pre-rendered on the
server, it may fallback to the page's loading state if your page contains
queries that request data missing from the initial page props. This can
create a flickering effect where the contents of the page rapidly changes
when the query data gets loaded into the app.

[Click here](./pages#first-render-ux) to discover ways you can improve the
first render User Experience (UX) of your pages.

#### Preview Mode

In some cases, you might want to temporarily bypass Static Generation and
render the page at **request time** instead of build time. For example,
you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before
they're published.

This use case is supported by Blitz by the feature called **Preview
Mode**. Learn more on the [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).
