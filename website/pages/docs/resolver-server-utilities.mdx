Blitz exports a `resolver` object which contains a few utilities.
"Resolver" as used here and for [queries](./query-resolvers) and
[mutations](./mutation-resolvers) refers to a function that takes some
input and "resolves" that into some output or side effect. This term is
commonly used for GraphQL. A resolver is separate from an API endpoint,
because in an API endpoint you have full access to the Node request and
response objects and you are responsible for managing the http stuff. But
resolvers are a layer removed from raw API handlers.

The below utilities are exported under the `resolver` object instead of
`resolverPipe` and `resolverZod` since they are commonly used together.
This cleans up your imports and makes it simple to discover any other
utilities on the `resolver` object.

## `resolver.pipe` {#resolver-pipe}

This is a functional pipe that makes it easier and cleaner to write
complex resolvers.

A pipe automatically pipes the output of one function into the next
function. Here's a non-Blitz example:

```ts
// Without pipe
export function (input1) {
  const output1 = function1(input1)
  const output2 = function2(output1)
  const output3 = function3(output2)
  return output3
}

// With pipe
export pipe(
  function1,
  function2,
  function3,
}
```

**Benefits:**

- It reduces the need for explicit TypeScript types
- One line to validate input data with a zod schema with `resolver.zod()`
- One line to authorize users with `resolver.authorize()`
- Enables functional composition

### Example {#example}

```ts
import { resolver } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

export const CreateProject = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  dueDate: z.date().optional(),
  orgId: z.number().optional(),
})

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(CreateProject),
  resolver.authorize(),
  // Set default orgId
  (input, { session }) => ({
    ...input,
    orgId: input.orgId ?? session.orgId,
  }),
  async (input, ctx) => {
    console.log("Creating project...", input.orgId)
    const project = await db.project.create({
      data: input,
    })
    console.log("Created project")
    return project
  }
)
```

<Card type="info">

The input type of the entire composed resolver function is determined by
the input type of the **first** argument to pipe.

This means you will almost always want `resolver.zod()` to be the first in
the pipe.

</Card>

### API {#api}

#### Arguments

It accepts from 1 to N functions which take input data as first argument
and [middleware `ctx`](./middleware) as the second argument.

The output of the first function is the first input argument of the next
function. The output of the last function is the final resolver result
data that will be sent to the client.

The TypeScript types are automatically inferred from one function to the
next.

```js
// 1 function
const resolver = resolver.pipe((input: ResolverInput, ctx: Ctx) => ResolverOutput)
// 2 functions
const resolver = resolver.pipe(
  (input: ResolverInput, ctx: Ctx) => A),
  (input: A, ctx: Ctx) => ResolverOutput),
)
// 3 functions
const resolver = resolver.pipe(
  (input: ResolverInput, ctx: Ctx) => A),
  (input: A, ctx: Ctx) => B),
  (input: B, ctx: Ctx) => ResolverOutput),
)
// ... etc
```

#### Returns

This returns a composed function of type `(input, ctx) => Promise<result>`
which is the standard resolver type.

## `resolver.zod` {#resolver-zod}

This is a handly utility for using
[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), an awesome input validation
library. It takes a zod schema and runs `schema.parseAsync` on the input
data.

> **Note**: If you want to run the synchronous version; `schema.parse`,
> you can pass in the value "sync" to the second parameter of resolver.zod
> E.g.: `resolver.zod(CreateProject,"sync")`

You don't have to use this. You can add
`const safeInput = CreateProject.parse(input)` directly in your main
resolver function. But then you also have to manually type the function
interface. The utility does everything in one step, setting input type and
validating the input data at runtime.

### Example {#example-1}

```ts
import { resolver } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import * as z from "zod"

export const CreateProject = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  dueDate: z.date().optional(),
  orgId: z.number().optional(),
})

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(CreateProject), // highlight-line
  async (input, ctx) => {
    // stuff
  }
)
```

### API {#api-1}

```js
const pipeFn = resolver.zod(MyZodSchema)
```

#### Arguments

- `ZodSchema:` a [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema
  - **Required**

#### Returns

A function to give `resolver.pipe` of type
`(rawInput, ctx: Ctx) => validInput`

## `resolver.authorize` {#resolver-authorize}

Using `resolver.authorize` in `resolver.pipe` is a simple way to check
whether the user has the authorization to call the query or mutation or
not. For this, blitz uses
[`session.$authorize`](./authorization#isauthorized-adapters) from the
context object.

### Example {#example-2}

```ts
import { resolver } from "@blitzjs/rpc"

export default resolver.pipe(
  // highlight-start
  resolver.authorize(),
  // resolver.authorize('admin'),
  // highlight-end
  async (input, ctx) => {
    // stuff
  }
)
```

### API {#api-2}

```js
const pipeFn = resolver.authorize(...isAuthorizedArgs)
```

#### Arguments

- `...isAuthorizedArgs`: The same arguments as your
  [`isAuthorized` adapter](./authorization#isauthorized-adapters)

#### Returns

A function to give `resolver.pipe` of type `(input, ctx: Ctx) => input`

## `paginate` {#paginate}

This is a handy utility for query pagination

### Example {#example-3}

```ts
import { paginate, Ctx } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import db, { Prisma } from "db"

interface GetProjectSInput
  extends Pick<
    Prisma.ProjectFindManyArgs,
    "where" | "orderBy" | "skip" | "take"
  > {}

export default async function getProjects(
  { where, orderBy, skip = 0, take = 100 }: GetProjectsInput,
  ctx: Ctx
) {
  ctx.session.$authorize()

  const {
    items: projects,
    hasMore,
    nextPage,
    count,
  } = await paginate({
    count: () => db.project.count({ where }),
    query: (paginateArgs) =>
      db.project.findMany({ ...paginateArgs, where, orderBy }),
    skip,
    take,
  })

  return {
    projects,
    nextPage,
    hasMore,
    count,
  }
}
```

### API {#api-3}

```js
const paginationData = await paginate(paginateArguments)
```

#### Arguments

- `count`: `() => Promise <number>`
  - **Required**
  - A function that returns a promise which resolves to a number
- `query`: `(payload: { skip: number; take: number }) => Promise<T>`
  - **Required**
  - A function that receives pagination payload and returns anything (type
    of return will be inherited by the pagination result).
- `skip`: `number`
  - How many rows to skip
- `take`: `number`
  - How many rows to take
- `maxTake`: `number`
  - The maximum value allowed for `take`. It protects your DB when "take"
    is sent by the user.
  - Defaults to 250.

#### Returns

- `paginationData`
  - `items`: `T` (Data resolver by the `query` function)
  - `nextPage`: `{ skip: number, take: number } | null` (Next page
    pagination payload)
  - `hasMore`: `boolean` (True if there are more items to load.)
  - `count`: `number` (Total number of items. Resolved by the `count`
    function)
