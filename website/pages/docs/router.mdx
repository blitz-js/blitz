There are two ways to access `router` within components.

1. `useRouter()` (recommended)
2. `withRouter()`

## `useRouter` {#use-router}

```jsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router"

function Thing({ href }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        color: router.pathname === href ? "red" : "black",
      }}
    />
  )
}

export default Thing
```

> `useRouter` is a
> [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), meaning it
> cannot be used with classes. You can either use
> [withRouter](#with-router) or wrap your class in a function component.

## `withRouter` {#with-router}

```jsx
import { withRouter } from "blitz"

function Page({ router }) {
  return <p>{router.pathname}</p>
}

export default withRouter(Page)
```

## `router` object {#router-object}

Here's the definition of the `router` object returned by `useRouter` and
`withRouter`:

- `pathname`: `String` - Current route. That is the path of the page in
  `/pages`, the configured `basePath` or `locale` is not included.
- `query`: `Object` - All the query string parameters from the current
  url. Parameter type is always `string`.
- `params`: `Object` - All the dynamic route parameters for the current
  route. Parameter types are `string` or `string[]`.
- `asPath`: `String` - The path (including the query) shown in the browser
  without the configured `basePath` or `locale`.
- `isFallback`: `boolean` - Whether the current page is in
  [fallback mode](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md#fallback-pages).
- `basePath`: `String` - The active [basePath](./blitz-config#base-path)
  (if enabled).
- `locale`: `String` - The active locale (if enabled).
- `locales`: `String[]` - All supported locales (if enabled).
- `defaultLocale`: `String` - The current default locale (if enabled).
- `domainLocales`: `Array<{domain, defaultLocale, locales}>` - Any
  configured domain locales.
- `isReady`: `boolean` - Whether the router fields are updated client-side
  and ready for use. Should only be used inside of `useEffect` methods and
  not for conditionally rendering on the server.
- `isPreview`: `boolean` - Whether the application is currently in
  [preview mode](./preview-mode). browser
- [`push()`](#router-push): Make page navigation
- [`replace()`](#router-replace): Make page navigation without adding to
  browser history
- [`back()`](#router-back): Navigate to previous history location
- [`reload()`](#router-reload): Reload the page
- [`prefetch()`](#router-prefetch): Prefetch pages for faster client-side
  transitions
- [`events`](#router-events): Subscribe to various router events
- [`beforePopState()`](#router-before-pop-state): For advanced routing
  needs

### Router API {#router-api}

The following router APIs can also be used via
`import {Router} from 'blitz'`

### Router.push {#router-push}

Handles client-side transitions, this method is useful for cases where
[`<Link>`](./link) is not enough.

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.push(url, as, options)
```

- `url` - The URL to navigate to. This is usually the name of a `page`
- `as` - Optional decorator for the URL that will be shown in the browser.
  Defaults to `url`
- `options` - Optional object with the following configuration options:
  - [`shallow`](./shallow-routing): Update the path of the current page
    without rerunning [`getStaticProps`](./get-static-props) or
    [`getServerSideProps`](./get-server-side-props). Defaults to `false`
- `locale` - Optional string, indicates locale of the new page

> You don't need to use `Router` for external URLs,
> [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location)
> is better suited for those cases.

#### Usage

Navigating to `pages/about.js`, which is a predefined route:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

function Page() {
  return <span onClick={() => Router.push("/about")}>Click me</span>
}
```

Navigating `pages/post/[pid].js`, which is a dynamic route:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

function Page() {
  return <span onClick={() => Router.push("/post/abc")}>Click me</span>
}
```

#### With URL object

You can use an URL object in the same way you can use it for
[`<Link>`](./link). Works for both the `url` and `as` parameters:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

const handler = () => {
  Router.push({
    pathname: "/about",
    query: { name: "Vercel" },
  })
}

function ReadMore() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click <span onClick={handler}>here</span> to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default ReadMore
```

### Router.replace {#router-replace}

Similar to the `replace` prop in [`<Link>`](./link), `Router.replace` will
prevent adding a new URL entry into the `history` stack, take a look at
the following example:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.replace("/home")
```

The API for `Router.replace` is exactly the same as that used for
[`Router.push`](#router-push).

### Router.back {#router-back}

Navigate back in history. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s back
button. It executes `window.history.back()`.

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.back()
```

### Router.reload {#router-reload}

Reload the current URL. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s refresh
button. It executes `window.location.reload()`.

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.reload()
```

### Router.prefetch {#router-prefetch}

Prefetch pages for faster client-side transitions. This method is only
useful for navigations without [`<Link>`](./link) because it takes care of
prefetching pages automatically.

> This is a production only feature. Blitz.js doesn't prefetch pages on
> development.

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.prefetch(url, as)
```

- `url` - The path to a `page` inside the `pages` directory
- `as` - Optional decorator for `url`, used to prefetch
  [dynamic routes](./routing#dynamic-route-segments). Defaults to `url`

#### Usage

Let's say you have a login page, and after a login, you redirect the user
to the dashboard. For that case, we can prefetch the dashboard to make a
faster transition, like in the following example:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

export default function Login() {
  const handleSubmit = React.useCallback((e) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    fetch("/api/login", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        /* Form data */
      }),
    }).then((res) => {
      // Do a fast client-side transition to the already prefetched dashboard page
      if (res.ok) Router.push("/dashboard")
    })
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Prefetch the dashboard page as the user will go there after the login
    Router.prefetch("/dashboard")
  }, [])

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Router.events {#router-events}

You can listen to different events happening inside the Router. Here's a
list of supported events:

- `routeChangeStart(url)` - Fires when a route starts to change
- `routeChangeComplete(url)` - Fires when a route changed completely
- `routeChangeError(err, url)` - Fires when there's an error when changing
  routes, or a route load is cancelled
  - `err.cancelled` - Indicates if the navigation was cancelled
- `beforeHistoryChange(url)` - Fires right before changing the browser's
  history
- `hashChangeStart(url)` - Fires when the hash will change but not the
  page
- `hashChangeComplete(url)` - Fires when the hash has changed but not the
  page

> Here `url` is the URL shown in the browser. If you call
> `Router.push(url, as)` (or similar), then the value of `url` will be
> `as`.

For example, to listen to the router event `routeChangeStart`, do the
following:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
  console.log("App is changing to: ", url)
}

Router.events.on("routeChangeStart", handleRouteChange)
```

If you no longer want to listen to the event, unsubscribe with the `off`
method:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.events.off("routeChangeStart", handleRouteChange)
```

If a route load is cancelled (for example, by clicking two links rapidly
in succession), `routeChangeError` will fire. And the passed `err` will
contain a `cancelled` property set to `true`, as in the following example:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.events.on("routeChangeError", (err, url) => {
  if (err.cancelled) {
    console.log(`Route to ${url} was cancelled!`)
  }
})
```

Router events should be registered when a component mounts
([useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) or
[componentDidMount](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount)
/
[componentWillUnmount](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillunmount))
or imperatively when an event happens, as in the following example:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

useEffect(() => {
  const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
    console.log("App is changing to: ", url)
  }

  Router.events.on("routeChangeStart", handleRouteChange)
  return () => {
    Router.events.off("routeChangeStart", handleRouteChange)
  }
}, [])
```

### Router.beforePopState {#router-before-pop-state}

In some cases (for example, if using a [Custom Server](./custom-server)),
you may wish to listen to
[popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate)
and do something before the router acts on it.

You could use this to manipulate the request, or force a SSR refresh, as
in the following example:

```jsx
import { Router } from "blitz"

Router.beforePopState(({ url, as, options }) => {
  // I only want to allow these two routes!
  if (as !== "/" && as !== "/other") {
    // Have SSR render bad routes as a 404.
    window.location.href = as
    return false
  }

  return true
})
```

`Router.beforePopState(cb: () => boolean)`

- `cb` - The function to run on incoming `popstate` events. The function
  receives the state of the event as an object with the following props:
  - `url`: `String` - the route for the new state. This is usually the
    name of a `page`
  - `as`: `String` - the url that will be shown in the browser
  - `options`: `Object` - Additional options sent by
    [Router.push](#router-push)

If the function you pass into `beforePopState` returns `false`, `Router`
will not handle `popstate` and you'll be responsible for handling it, in
that case. See
[Disabling file-system routing](./custom-server#disabling-file-system-routing).
