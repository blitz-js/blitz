You can customize advanced behavior of Blitz with `blitz.config.js` or
`blitz.config.ts`.

Take a look at the following `blitz.config.js` example:

```js
module.exports = {
  /* config options here */
}
```

You can also use a function:

```js
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  return {
    /* config options here */
  }
}
```

`phase` is the current context in which the configuration is loaded. You
can see the available phases
[here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/shared/lib/constants.ts#L1-L4).
Phases can be imported from `next/constants`:

```js
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from "next/constants"

module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
    return {
      /* development only config options here */
    }
  }

  return {
    /* config options for all phases except development here */
  }
}
```

The commented lines are the place where you can put the configs allowed by
`blitz.config.js`, which are defined
[here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/next-server/server/config.ts#L12-L63).

However, none of the configs are required, and it's not necessary to
understand what each config does, instead, search for the features you
need to enable or modify in this section and they will show you what to
do.

## Webpack Config {#webpack-config}

You can customize the Blitz webpack config. See
[our webpack documentation](./webpack-config) for details

## Build Target {#build-target}

Blitz supports various build targets, each changing the way your
application is built and run. We'll explain each of the targets below.

#### `server` target

Your application will be built and deployed as a monolith. This is the
default target and no action is required on your part to opt-in.

#### `serverless` target

This target will output independent pages that don't require a monolithic
server.

It's only compatible with Serverless deployment platforms (like
[Vercel](https://vercel.com)) — you cannot use the custom server API.

To opt-into this target, set the following configuration in your
`blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
}
```

## Middleware {#middleware}

HTTP middleware can be added queries and mutations.
[See the middleware documentation](./middleware) for full details.

```js
module.exports = {
  middleware: [
    (req, res, next) => {
      res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
      return next()
    },
  ],
```

## Logging {#logging}

### Log Level {#log-level}

By default Blitz logs various things at runtime. You can adjust the
verbosity using the log level setting.

- Default: `info`
- Options: `trace` | `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` | `fatal`

```js
module.exports = {
  log: {
    level: "info",
  },
}
```

### Log Type {#log-type}

It is also possible to adjust the logging type, which could be helpful if
you prefer to forward the logs in JSON format.

- Default: `pretty`
- Options: `pretty` | `json` | `hidden`

```js
module.exports = {
  log: {
    type: "pretty",
  },
}
```

## Codegen {#codegen}

If you want to use custom templates with `blitz generate` instead of the
default ones (e.g. with different styles), you can provide a path to the
local template directory:

```js
module.exports = {
  codegen: {
    templateDir: "./templates",
  },
}
```

The template directory should have the following structure:

```
.
├── form
│   └── __ModelName__Form.tsx
├── mutation
│   └── __input__.ts
├── mutations
│   ├── create__ModelName__.ts
│   ├── delete__ModelName__.ts
│   └── update__ModelName__.ts
├── page
│   ├── __modelIdParam__
│   │   └── edit.tsx
│   ├── __modelIdParam__.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── new.tsx
├── queries
│   ├── get__ModelName__.ts
│   └── get__ModelNames__.ts
└── query
    └── __name__.ts
```

If some folders are omitted in your custom template directory,
`blitz generate` will fallback to the default templates. You can check
them out
[here](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/generator/templates).

## CLI {#cli}

### Clear Console On Blitz Dev {#clear-console-on-blitz-dev}

When you run `blitz dev`, the console gets cleared. You can disable it by
setting the `cli.clearConsoleOnBlitzDev` to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  cli: {
    clearConsoleOnBlitzDev: false,
  },
}
```

### Proxy support {#proxy-support}

Proxy support is enabled automatically for recipe install if either
`http_proxy` or `https_proxy` environment variable is present. You can
also set proxy using:

```js
module.exports = {
  cli: {
    httpProxy: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    httpsProxy: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    noProxy: "localhost",
  },
}
```

Please note that proxy configuration in `blitz.config.js` will override
environment proxy configuration.

## CDN Support with Asset Prefix {#cdn-support-with-asset-prefix}

To set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network),
you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve
to the domain that Blitz is hosted on.

```js
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"

module.exports = {
  // Use the CDN in production and localhost for development.
  assetPrefix: isProd ? "https://cdn.mydomain.com" : "",
}
```

Blitz.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and
CSS files it loads from the `/_next/` path (`.next/static/` folder). For
example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS
chunk:

```
/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

Would instead become:

```
https://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

The exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will
depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN
is the contents of `.next/static/`, which should be uploaded as
`_next/static/` as the above URL request indicates. **Do not upload the
rest of your `.next/` folder**, as you should not expose your server code
and other configuration to the public.

While `assetPrefix` covers requests to `_next/static`, it does not
influence the following paths:

- Files in the [public](./static-files) folder; if you want to serve those
  assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself
- `/_next/data/` requests for `getServerSideProps` pages. These requests
  will always be made against the main domain since they're not static.
- `/_next/data/` requests for `getStaticProps` pages. These requests will
  always be made against the main domain to support
  [Incremental Static Generation](./get-static-props), even if you're not
  using it (for consistency).

## Custom Page Extensions {#custom-page-extensions}

Aimed at modules like
[@next/mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx),
which adds support for pages ending with `.mdx`. You can configure the
extensions looked for in the `pages` directory when resolving pages.

```js
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ["mdx", "jsx", "js", "ts", "tsx"],
}
```

## Static Optimization Indicator {#static-optimization-indicator}

When a page qualifies for
[Automatic Static Optimization](./pages#automatic-static-optimization) we
show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial
and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be
useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on
electron applications.

```js
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```

## Configuring onDemandEntries for Development {#configuring-on-demand-entries-for-development}

Blitz exposes some options that give you some control over how the server
will dispose or keep in memory built pages in development.

```js
module.exports = {
  onDemandEntries: {
    // period (in ms) where the server will keep pages in the buffer
    maxInactiveAge: 25 * 1000,
    // number of pages that should be kept simultaneously without being disposed
    pagesBufferLength: 2,
  },
}
```

## Setting a custom build directory {#setting-a-custom-build-directory}

You can specify a name to use for a custom build directory to use instead
of `.next`.

```js
module.exports = {
  distDir: "build",
}
```

Now if you run `blitz build` Blitz will use `build` instead of the default
`.next` folder.

> `distDir` **should not** leave your project directory. For example,
> `../build` is an **invalid** directory.

## Configuring the Build ID {#configuring-the-build-id}

Blitz uses a constant id generated at build time to identify which version
of your application is being served. This can cause problems in
multi-server deployments when `blitz build` is ran on every server. In
order to keep a static build id between builds you can provide your own
build id.

```js
module.exports = {
  generateBuildId: async () => {
    // You can, for example, get the latest git commit hash here
    return "my-build-id"
  },
}
```

## Compression {#compression}

Blitz provides [**gzip**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713#section-3)
compression to compress rendered content and static files. Compression
only works with the [`server` target](#server-target). In general you will
want to enable compression on a HTTP proxy like
[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), to offload load from the `Node.js`
process.

```js
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

## Disabling ETag Generation {#disabling-e-tag-generation}

By default we generate [etags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag)
for every page by default. You may want to disable etag generation for
HTML pages depending on your cache strategy.

```js
module.exports = {
  generateEtags: false,
}
```

## Disabling x-powered-by {#disabling-x-powered-by}

By default Blitz adds the `x-powered-by` header. To opt-out of it, disable
the `poweredByHeader` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  poweredByHeader: false,
}
```

## Base Path {#base-path}

To deploy a Blitz application under a sub-path of a domain you can use the
`basePath` config option.

`basePath` allows you to set a path prefix for the application. For
example, to use `/docs` instead of `/` (the default), open
`blitz.config.js` and add the `basePath` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  basePath: "/docs",
}
```

Note: this value must be set at build time and can not be changed without
re-building as the value is inlined in the client-side bundles.

### Links {#links}

When linking to other pages using `Link` and `Router` the `basePath` will
be automatically applied.

For example using `/about` will automatically become `/docs/about` when
`basePath` is set to `/docs`.

```js
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link href={Routes.About()}>
        <a>About Page</a>
      </Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

Output html:

```html
<a href="/docs/about">About Page</a>
```

This makes sure that you don't have to change all links in your
application when changing the `basePath` value.

## Trailing Slash {#trailing-slash}

By default Blitz will redirect urls with trailing slashes to their
counterpart without a trailing slash. For example `/about/` will redirect
to `/about`. You can configure this behavior to act the opposite way,
where urls without trailing slashes are redirected to their counterparts
with trailing slashes.

Open `blitz.config.js` and add the `trailingSlash` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

With this option set, urls like `/about` will redirect to `/about/`.

## Custom Server {#custom-server}

You can setup and configure some items in the blitz config regarding
custom servers. [See the custom server documentation](./custom-server) for
full details.

## Experimental {#experimental}

These features aren't ready for production and could change at any time.

### Isomorphic Resolver Imports {#isomorphic-resolver-imports}

This enables isomorphic code imports from resolver files (for example
exporting a zod schema from a mutation and being able to import that in
client code).

- Default: `false`

```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    isomorphicResolverImports: true,
  },
}
```

### React Root Mode {#react-mode}

By default Blitz uses
[React Concurrent Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).
You can disable it by changing `experimental.reactRoot` to `false`.

- Default: `true`

```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    reactRoot: false,
  },
}
```

### Disabling HTTP Keep-Alive {#disable-keep-alive}

Blitz.js automatically polyfills
[node-fetch](/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#polyfills)
and enables
[HTTP Keep-Alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive)
by default. You may want to disable HTTP Keep-Alive for certain `fetch()`
calls or globally.

For a single `fetch()` call, you can add the agent option:

```js
import { Agent } from "https"

const url = "https://example.com"
const agent = new Agent({ keepAlive: false })
fetch(url, { agent })
```

To override all `fetch()` calls globally, you can use `blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  httpAgentOptions: {
    keepAlive: false,
  },
}
```
