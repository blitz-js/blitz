Blitz has built-in support for internationalized
([i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Naming))
routing. You can provide a list of locales, the default locale, and
domain-specific locales and Blitz will automatically handle the routing.

The i18n routing support is currently meant to complement existing i18n
library solutions like
[`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation),
[`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/),
[`lingui`](https://lingui.js.org/),
[`rosetta`](https://github.com/lukeed/rosetta),
[`next-intl`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl) and others by
streamlining the routes and locale parsing.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

To get started, add the `i18n` config to your `blitz.config.js` file.

Locales are
[UTS Locale Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers),
a standardized format for defining locales.

Generally a Locale Identifier is made up of a language, region, and script
separated by a dash: `language-region-script`. The region and script are
optional. An example:

- `en-US` - English as spoken in the United States
- `nl-NL` - Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands
- `nl` - Dutch, no specific region

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    // These are all the locales you want to support in
    // your application
    locales: ["en-US", "fr", "nl-NL"],
    // This is the default locale you want to be used when visiting
    // a non-locale prefixed path e.g. `/hello`
    defaultLocale: "en-US",
    // This is a list of locale domains and the default locale they
    // should handle (these are only required when setting up domain routing)
    domains: [
      {
        domain: "example.com",
        defaultLocale: "en-US",
      },
      {
        domain: "example.nl",
        defaultLocale: "nl-NL",
      },
      {
        domain: "example.fr",
        defaultLocale: "fr",
        // an optional http field can also be used to test
        // locale domains locally with http instead of https
        http: true,
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

## Locale Strategies {#locale-strategies}

There are two locale handling strategies: Sub-path Routing and Domain
Routing.

### Sub-path Routing {#sub-path-routing}

Sub-path Routing puts the locale in the url path.

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en-US", "fr", "nl-NL"],
    defaultLocale: "en-US",
  },
}
```

With the above configuration `en-US`, `fr`, and `nl-NL` will be available
to be routed to, and `en-US` is the default locale. If you have a
`pages/blog.js` the following urls would be available:

- `/blog`
- `/fr/blog`
- `/nl-nl/blog`

The default locale does not have a prefix.

### Domain Routing {#domain-routing}

By using domain routing you can configure locales to be served from
different domains:

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en-US", "fr", "nl-NL", "nl-BE"],
    defaultLocale: "en-US",

    domains: [
      {
        domain: "example.com",
        defaultLocale: "en-US",
      },
      {
        domain: "example.fr",
        defaultLocale: "fr",
      },
      {
        domain: "example.nl",
        defaultLocale: "nl-NL",
        // specify other locales that should be redirected
        // to this domain
        locales: ["nl-BE"],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

For example if you have `pages/blog.js` the following urls will be
available:

- `example.com/blog`
- `example.fr/blog`
- `example.nl/blog`
- `example.nl/nl-BE/blog`

## Automatic Locale Detection {#automatic-locale-detection}

When a user visits the application root (generally `/`), Blitz will try to
automatically detect which locale the user prefers based on the
[`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)
header and the current domain.

If a locale other than the default locale is detected, the user will be
redirected to either:

- **When using Sub-path Routing:** The locale prefixed path
- **When using Domain Routing:** The domain with that locale specified as
  the default

When using Domain Routing, if a user with the `Accept-Language` header
`fr;q=0.9` visits `example.com`, they will be redirected to `example.fr`
since that domain handles the `fr` locale by default.

When using Sub-path Routing, the user would be redirected to `/fr`.

### Disabling Automatic Locale Detection {#disabling-automatic-locale-detection}

The automatic locale detection can be disabled with:

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    localeDetection: false,
  },
}
```

When `localeDetection` is set to `false` Blitz will no longer
automatically redirect based on the user's preferred locale and will only
provide locale information detected from either the locale based domain or
locale path as described above.

## Accessing the locale information {#accessing-the-locale-information}

You can access the locale information via the Blitz router. For example,
using the [`useRouter()`](/docs/router/#userouter) hook the following
properties are available:

- `locale` contains the currently active locale.
- `locales` contains all configured locales.
- `defaultLocale` contains the configured default locale.

When [pre-rendering](/docs/pages#automatic-static-optimization) pages with
`getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, the locale information is
provided in [the context](/docs/get-static-props) provided to the
function.

When leveraging `getStaticPaths`, the configured locales are provided in
the context parameter of the function under `locales` and the configured
defaultLocale under `defaultLocale`.

## Transition between locales {#transition-between-locales}

You can use `Link` or `Router` to transition between locales.

For `Link`, a `locale` prop can be provided to transition to a different
locale from the currently active one. If no `locale` prop is provided, the
currently active `locale` is used during client-transitions. For example:

```jsx
import { Link } from "blitz"

export default function IndexPage(props) {
  return (
    <Link href="/another" locale="fr">
      <a>To /fr/another</a>
    </Link>
  )
}
```

When using the `Router` methods directly, you can specify the `locale`
that should be used via the transition options. For example:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from "blitz"

export default function IndexPage(props) {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <div
      onClick={() => {
        router.push("/another", "/another", { locale: "fr" })
      }}
    >
      to /fr/another
    </div>
  )
}
```

If you have a `href` that already includes the locale you can opt-out of
automatically handling the locale prefixing:

```jsx
import { Link } from "blitz"

export default function IndexPage(props) {
  return (
    <Link href="/fr/another" locale={false}>
      <a>To /fr/another</a>
    </Link>
  )
}
```

## Leveraging the NEXT_LOCALE cookie {#leveraging-the-next-locale-cookie}

Blitz supports overriding the accept-language header with a
`NEXT_LOCALE=the-locale` cookie. This cookie can be set using a language
switcher and then when a user comes back to the site it will leverage the
locale specified in the cookie.

For example, if a user prefers the locale `fr` but a `NEXT_LOCALE=en`
cookie is set the `en` locale will be used instead until the cookie is
removed or expired.

## Search Engine Optimization {#search-engine-optimization}

Since Blitz knows what language the user is visiting it will automatically
add the `lang` attribute to the `<html>` tag.

Blitz doesn't know about variants of a page so it's up to you to add the
`hreflang` meta tags using [`Head`](/docs/head-component). You can learn
more about `hreflang` in the
[Google Webmasters documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077).

## How does this work with Static Generation? {#how-does-this-work-with-static-generation}

### Automatically Statically Optimized Pages {#automatically-statically-optimized-pages}

For pages that are
[automatically statically optimized](/docs/pages#automatic-static-optimization),
a version of the page will be generated for each locale.

### Non-dynamic getStaticProps Pages {#non-dynamic-get-static-props-pages}

For non-dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, a version is generated for each
locale like above. `getStaticProps` is called with each `locale` that is
being rendered. If you would like to opt-out of a certain locale from
being pre-rendered, you can return `notFound: true` from `getStaticProps`
and this variant of the page will not be generated.

```js
export async function getStaticProps({ locale }) {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.
  // You can use any data fetching library
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts?locale=${locale}`)
  const posts = await res.json()

  if (posts.length === 0) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    }
  }

  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

### Dynamic getStaticProps Pages {#dynamic-get-static-props-pages}

For dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, any locale variants of the page that
is desired to be prerendered needs to be returned from
[`getStaticPaths`](/docs/get-static-paths). Along with the `params` object
that can be returned for the `paths`, you can also return a `locale` field
specifying which locale you want to render. For example:

```js
// pages/blog/[slug].js
export const getStaticPaths = ({ locales }) => {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { slug: "post-1" }, locale: "en-US" },
      { params: { slug: "post-1" }, locale: "fr" },
    ],
    fallback: true,
  }
}
```
