# Blitz.js Governance

_From Brandon Bayer (@flybayer), the creator:_

Currently at this very early stage it's basically a [BDFL situation](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects), with me having the final say in decisions.

However we will move away from BDFL to something that looks more like Ember.js. It's extremely important to me (Brandon) that Blitz.js is a long-term, sustainable, and community-run project.

I would love some mentorship from people with experience in large open-source projects on making this transition.

Also, it's possible I will create one or more business around Blitz, perhaps similar to how Taylor Otwell has around Laravel, but Blitz itself will always remain a separate community-run project.
